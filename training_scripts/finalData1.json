microwave some leftovers for myself so i proceeded into our kitchen which looks out onto our deck via french doors and a small window above the sink. when preparing my food and washing the utensils i noticed that outside clouds had set just over the sun creating a very interesting refraction effect with the light rays, deciding that the scene was quite pretty i went outside to take a picture of it, and that was the end of it until the christmas of 2017 when my grandfather was staying with us. i was clearing my gallery and was debating deleting the picture in question when i noticed what appeared to be a blue lens flare of sorts in the upper right corner of the image just inside the cloud cover. upon closer inspection it appeared to be a spherical possibly oval object with white lights lining the surface casting a bluish-green glow on the object's surface. the object appeared to be slowly ascending towards the south judging by the slight trail the surface lights made. when i realized that the object appeared to be a ufo i showed the image to my grandfather because he is convinced on the notion of \"aliens visiting earth\" and would be surprised and entertained by the image. to him the image appeared very convincing and at the time he was stunned. personally i'm not as convinced about the aforementioned notion so i was simply entertained by his reaction to the image. fast forward to the day this statement was written (january 30 2018) my grandfather, myself and my uncle were all in attendance at a dinner where my grandfather brought up the subject of my photograph. piquing the interest of my uncle i showed him the image in question and similar to my uncle he was shocked by the spherical object, and afterwards he directed me to this website to submit

some thick ribs spaced quite a disatance apart.Joined together with something thinner & darker. the pinnacle of the isocoles triangle had a space where a star sized magenta light twinkled. then as i was trying to see it clearly, it flashed. after the flash it got a brighter white & all the other lights on the tubes grew brighter to drown out any definition. the clouds then moved until it was covered completely.\n5.I was suprised. shocked how large this triangli noticed that there is a structure (metallic/lead)not very shiny,but also not reflecting the long bright white light. i was

looking because after i noticed the triangle shaped light in the sky, i grew up not far frorm a naval air base in the country, on their landing & departure path. bucks county fields where i saw f18's pilot wave at me below radar as a kid on my bike. so, i know this wasn't even a flying wing or black triangle. i know about the tr3b. i've driven down the highway at night when what i think was a stealth came in and was above my vehicle. afterwards, i looked around. haven't seen a picture like this triangle. definately not. no light arrangement in a long rectangle. no \"connecting dark tube?

daughters home in washington d.C. to go to reagan international airport to catch my plane to return to wheatland, pa. it was between 7 or 8 a.M., right before thanksgiving 2017. i had just visited my daughter and cared for my grandson because he had the flu and his dad had taken his mom on a trip to china because my daughter had to work. so my son- in- law, me and his mom we\u2019re walking out to his car parked in the back because she was leaving for nyc the same day i was going home too. as he was putting the luggage in the car i happened to hear a jet approaching and looked up because you never know what kind of flyer you will see going over d.C. before i spotted the jet, which i could here clearly, i see the metal crap just hovering above us, pretty high up, not making a sound. i can\u2019t tell what it is because it\u2019s silent and it seemed to be changing or like morphing but it seemed solid. coming in from my right is the jet i heard clearly, even though it was alot higher up than the other craft. i didn\u2019t say anything to my son-in-law or his mom because he would have made me feel like a kook and his mother wouldn\u2019t have a clue. so i start taking as many pictures as i can before i have to get in the car. my son-in-law prid s himself on his knowledge of anything the flies so when i showed him the pictures i took and since he knows his backyard assumed it had to be a helicopter. but if it was where he thought it was, it would had been so loud he would have noticed at the time. in the last picture i took you can see the jet coming into frame and the top far right. you can judge the size when the jet appears. i was hoping you guys could be able to zoom in better than i could to tell what it is. i have had many experiences with ufo\u2019s

ibis i noticed an orb/ball hovering still in the sky that then started to move from south to north - it occasionally slowed to a stop before starting to move again in a reasonaably straight line. it was traveling very slowly and nothing like the plane i saw a few minutes earlier.\n\ni asked my wife to keep watch while i went indoors and got my binoculars and digital camera. i took some photos on full optical and digital zoom that are not particularly clear due to the distance and reflection off the object. \n\nthrough the binoculars however i could see that the object was a solid ball but could not ascertain the size as i had nothing to compare it to. i would guess it was maybe 1 meter or so in diameter as it was definitely not as big as an aircraft but larger than the ibis (they have an average wingspan of 110  - 123cm).\n\neventually the object moved in a large arc to the west before going behind a cloud. the cloud dissipated and the object was gone - i had been watching the whole time and it did not re-appear from the cloud but just vanished.\n\ni initially thought it may have been a satellite as i had observed them before but when it changed direction and came to a

the last we saw of them for the night due to buildings blocking that portion of the night sky.\n\ni should note the distance between each of the lights could not have been more than a few hundred feet. while this happened, several passenger planes could be seen flying in the distance. the lights and the way they carried themselves were completely and totally different from the four lights we

about 5:40 a.M. or so, i went outside to start my car and get ready to head to work.  the sky was crystal clear and the moon was nearly full and about as bright as it can be.  i looked up at it and noticed that there was a nice contrail growing in the sky, just past the moon.  it stood out as almost glowing because of the moon, and it was very wide as compared to most visible contrails.  i followed the contrail to the right to see if i could make out what was making it. i then noticed that leading the contrail was a perfect triangle, blacker than the sky, with an amber / yellow constant light on the each corner.  i watched for a few seconds then decided to take a photo of it.  it was minus zero, so by the time i threw my gloves off and dug my phone out, i really only got one shot.\n\ni didn\u2019t hear any typical jet noises, but my impression was that the object was a lot lower than a typical jet leaving contrails, because the amber lights were so clearly noticeable.  \n\nlater i got to work and looked at the photo and all i really saw on my phone was a blurry shot of the moon and another bright spot which i assume is venus.  but, i sent the photo to my work computer, and opened it up on my large screen.  if you look to the right of the blurry moon, you will see the contrail.  follow the contrail to its origin, and you see a three pointed blurry image.  very disappointing.  however, if you zoom in a little, and follow the contrail back about half ways, you will see two distinct triangle pattern of lights, which appear to be following the lead object.I was not aware of these additional object when i was observing it in real time.\n\nas i stated, i didn\u2019t hear any noises at all, and i was not aware of the two smaller light patterns following the main triangle. the contrail was just lit up so bright by the moon behind it, that is what caught my attention initially. it was so wide, that i wanted to see what was making it.  the contrail seemed to be one single wide element, and i wanted to see what would make it. the craft was completely black, and stood out against the dark night sky. the yellowish light on each corner was fairly large compared to the size of the triangle, and was inset a little on each corner, it was not incorporated into the corner itself, it appeared that they were attached to the bottom.  there were no red or green blinking navigation lights. the craft was about half the diameter of the moon, and appeared about the same size as you would view a low flying cessna plane. based upon the visiblity of the outline of the triangle and the apperance of the lights, i would say that the craft was either very large, or fairly low, but i have never seen a low aircraft make a contrail.\n\ni believe that the general direction of travel for the objects were south to north or a little more southeast to northwest.  maybe i caught something heading back to wright-patt afb in dayton?\n\ni will attach the photo.  the triangle is blurry, but the two other triangle light formations are pretty clear.", "reported_at": "2018-01-26"},{"imange_name": "40.png", "sighted_at": "2017-01-24", "image_tags": "solar

the same straight path. it moved slightly  to the right when it went past the satellite. that was the first weird thing. i could distinctly see it move around the sat.\n\nafter passing the sat, it slowed, and moved left, before making a u-turn in a big circle, facing the satellite it just passed. it stopped for a few seconds. then moved toward the satellite. then it went backwards (without appearing to turn around). it moved around a little, as if settling in, and then just stops. there was a star to the west of it. i believe it is called arcturus. but i'm not sure. the star vega was north east of the object. hopefully this helps you locate where it was in the sky. jupiter/mars was south east of the object.\n\ni watched it in the same spot for about an hour. during that time, i could see extremely faint/dim \"star like objects\" coming and going from the original object. some would float away. some would shoot away like a shooting star. this made me feel very uncomfortable.

think it moved around slightly, but that could just be my imagination. \n\ni hope others saw the same thing because it was amazing. i wish i had the ability to record it on video with good quality.

"description": "On march 17, 2016, while at home, i opened an app that i had downloaded on my ipad called iss hd live.  it\u2019s an app that allows the viewer to see a live feed broadcast from the international space station, and i enjoy the app as background entertainment while i do work online.  this day i opened the app and instead of the usual view of earth from orbit, i was greeted by two views of the sun, apparently being observed from the iss.  it was a split screen, on the left side was a filtered view of the sun and on the right side was a zoomed in view of the same scene.  they were labeled \u201cmacro view\u201d on the left and \u201cmicro view\u201d on the right.\n\nto my astonishment i observed two very bright objects, like plasma or something, appear from the far right of the screen and move to the left toward the surface of the sun.  i watched them move to the sun and seem to land on it.  very quickly they began to swell to large balloon like objects as they seemingly drew plasma from the surface of the sun.  more lights appeared while this was happening and in the midst of them was a very distinct dark colored object that suddenly appeared near the sun and began to release blobs of plasma that followed the same behavior as the previous ones.  i began to take screen shots because i\u2019m pretty familiar with sun activity and this didn\u2019t seem like anything anyone has seen before. \n\nat first, i thought maybe this was a solar flare.  it resembles a flare in some ways, however, solar flares begin on the sun and these plasma like balls of light appeared from the right side of the screen and moved to the sun!  they also began as balls of light but grew to enormous proportions while apparently attached to the sun in groups that are arranged symmetrically, as you can see in the attached photos.  that isn\u2019t a solar flare, so i thought maybe meteors.  i am pretty sure however that meteors do not hover.  also, the \u201cplasma balloons\u201d that were attached to the sun seemed to have an outline of some sort, dark like some sort of container, or force that was keeping the plasma together in an elongated sphere.\n\nthe biggest problem here with this being natural phenomena is the dark object seemingly controlling these plasma things.  the object is clearly visible in the attached photos.  one screen grab actually defines edges to this object, making it appear as a very large rectangle stood up on end.  for it to be as visible as it was, it must have been larger than the earth itself, based on its scale to the sun.  i was stunned at what i was seeing and i took 8 screenshots throughout this event.  only 8 because i was arguing logic with myself and in denial of what was happening, and happening live all over the world, at least to those watching the feed at that time.  i can not be the only one to witness this though i may be the only one who thought to screen grab it, i do not know.\n\nthe most dramatic event took place at the end of this event.  these plasma things attached to the sun blinked out all at once, and appeared again way less than a second later and had merged into one very bright and extremely large barred circle of i guess plasma.  it has to be many times bigger than the entire earth.  this is also visible in the attached photos.  the feed ended at this point and went to a blue screen.  this was a live video feed, so it\u2019s likley that the iss has a copy of this footage somewhere.\n\ni sat on these photos for over a year because i simply had no idea what to do with them.  and i was sure i would find a natural explanation for all this.  i\u2019ve found none.  i didn\u2019t want to put these out there and find out they are explainable, i\u2019d feel silly!  so i\u2019ve tried and tried to find out what this could be, and really there is no known phenomena that takes the characteristics described above.  so now i\u2019ll give them to you guys.  please at some point if possible at all, get in touch with me via email address i provided and tell me this  is a natural phenomena or something so i can rest my mind on this!  but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s natural at all.\n\nthank you for considering this report,\npaul meyers", "reported_at": "2018-01-25"},{"imange_name": "45.png", "sighted_at": "1990-07-31", "image_tags": "volcano", "shape":

small converted garage with a friend. i was backpacking around australia. there was no glazing in the property (tropical climate), only mosquito screens on window openings throughout. the main entrance was an existing garage door, therefore large and facing the road which was about 20m away. this opening was netted also and had a wooden frame with a normal door size opening to enter,within it. opposite this opening, against the far wall, was my single bed. it had a window (netted) over the bedhead facing the other direction. behind the house was forested swampland with no properties. \n   on the other side of the road was a forested mountain; mount mackay national park and as such there were also no properties in the view from the entrance. this mountain was regarded by me as somewhere between a hill and a mountain. it is completely undeveloped with dense and tropical rainforest cover. \n   on the evening in question, i got into bed to go to sleep. it was probably around 9pm to 10pm and dark as sunset was around 6pm. my friend had also retired for the evening. all lights were off and it was totally dark. there were no streetlights or any man made lighting to be seen in this location at the time (quite remote). i remember it being a clear evening, no wind and in the mid 20's degrees celsius, i estimate. \n   normally i sleep without problems of any sort but after what must have been an hour of tossing and turning in bed, i found myself asking the question, \"what's wrong?\" it soon dawned on me that the reason i could not fall asleep was because i was afraid! i remember distinctly feeling that this realisation startled me into full alertness. i realised that i had the distinct feeling of being watched!\n   i immediately sat up in bed and peered through the mosquito mesh through the window behind me. as it is low lying wooded swampland in that direction, i couldn't see a thing, there was nothing but total blackness. after reassuring myself that i was being \"silly\" i turned back and as i was lying down again looked out of the entrance/ garage door opening opposite and i could clearly see mount mackay, silhouetted against the night sky. it was really rather bright in this direction. i saw a lone star above the mountain and to the right and thought, \"wow, that's a bright star!\" then it dawned on me that it was way too bright to be a star. it was illuminating the hillside forest and i estimate that it had a similar intensity to a full moon. it was however smaller than a full moon. looking back, its actual size was difficult to gauge. as i said, it was like a very bright and very large star. it was close to the ground, a few hundred meters maybe, again it's hard to give a good estimate for something without features or sound. \n   then i remember that i said to myself, \"that's not a star, that's a u.F...\" to my astonishment, and before i could finish the sentence, the object immediately moved to the left and down, in the path that i would describe like if you roll a coin off of a table, a parabolic arched path maybe?!It did not seem to accelerate but moved from a standstill and kept a constant speed. the timing of my realisation and its starting to move out of sight was the most alarming thing about it. to this day i am convinced this was not a coincidence, but rather it had been monitoring me and my thoughts. that may sound like paranoia. regardless, i genuinely believe this fact, and given the very real fear i had experienced beforehand, point logically to the possibility of this.\nthe object disappeared behind the ridge of the mountain which i estimate to be 1 or 2 km away. i took about 1 second to move from a standstill to being out of sight. i looked for just a few seconds waiting for it to reappear but it didn't. i then went to sleep, without any problem, the feeling of being watched had gone! \nlooking back, i am surprised i did not question it; wait longer for it to reappear; search its possible landing site the next day, etc.\n   later that year, while picking grapes as seasonal work, i went to the library and found a book on ufo sightings in australia. i read it and it discussed finding swamp-weed cicles (like crop circles) in the swamps around the tully area! tully, queensland was approx 5km from the location of this incident. it may have been the book; alien honeycomb: the first solid evidence of ufos by john pinkney and leonard ryzman as i read this book around that time in australia, though not 100% certain. i remember this passing explanation in the book for reasons obvious.\n   this is not the only ufo sighting i have had, but i think it was an encounter of the \"second kind\" and as such, felt it worth documenting for research purposes. i hope it is of some use. i have attempted to  make a photo-montage rendering using google earth showing the exact location, and it is attached. this is a very close approximation of what i experienced showing the objects position before it moved.\n\nthanks!\nds", "reported_at": "2018-01-25"},{"imange_name": "46.png", "sighted_at": "2018-01-09", "image_tags": "limousine, limo", "shape": "Triangle",

happend before but the closer it came i could see it was a red pulsing orb of light.It came to a couple hundred feet away and then turned to the south and almost stoped. then i noticed 2 more that seemed to come out of know where.I was having a hard time to keep my plane in the air and watch them too and i was getting very scared by then so i landed it as fast as i could.These things changed direction and altitude at free will.. i started to run across the field as fast as i could back to the car and as i did 2 of them slowly followed me right to the car maybe 100 to 200 feet above me.I seen aprox 8 to 12 of them,i was pretty shaken up.I drove back through the campground to our cabin.I ran into the cabin to tell my friend what i seen,she then told me she was videoing me and got 3 of them on video.I went back outside with her and a few more flew right over the cabin.She took another short video of one she was able to focus on.I then took a couple pictures of them that seem to only be a couple hundred feet above me at most.In the video and looking at them they look like red orbs but when you zoom in on my pictures you can clearly see they are two different shapes and they don't even look red.One was almost tube shape and the other was kind of round with almost what looks like a tail. they were following me for sure..Some flew back up into the sky and some seemed to go to the south east before going out of sight..I was pretty scared and in shock of what just happened.I have both videos on youtube but my pictures i have show different shapes that you could'nt see by the

the object is sphere shaped and appears to both reflect and emit light. i can't say with any confidence the size or altitude of the object but it did appear to be rather high. \n\nas i was viewing the

pulsating rapidly like a strobe light and at the center of it was a black hole. after about five minutes the pulsating stopped as well as the object. i had a good view of it through my telescope, crystal clear and close, it was amazing to look at. the sphere was perfectly smooth and had a bluish white glow to it. it reminded me of the glow from an incandescent light bulb. we were talking about how strange it is and wondering what it could be. one of the neighbors viewed through my telescope and said \"i don't know what to think of that, it does not look like anything from this world that i have ever seen.\" after about ten minutes of the object remaining motionless it started breaking up into smaller parts starting at the lower section of the sphere and moving up.It formed four separate \"arms\" made up of smaller parts that arched up and around the sphere and met into a point above it, and then it was gone. it was hard to believe what i had just seen. i think about it often.\n\nthis is an unusual event on it's own. but, what makes it even more unusual and unique is that it's not the only time i have seen it. i have seen the object multiple times at the same location, around the

was driving uphill, looked up, and noticed blinking lights above me about 70 degrees above horizon that at first i thought were an airliner. but then i noticed it was unusual and there were two: huge winged craft, one much higher and farther away; each like a single, thin horizontal bar, very slightly angled up toward the ends, with equally spaced lights (about 10) running entire length of bar, blinking randomly in various light colors; no structure visible (no underside, sides, or anything behind or above the bar of lights); lights were not bright like jet lights appear head-on, but more like \u201crunning lights\u201d; no physical movements of craft itself; stationary in the sky, despite winds; craft always facing in one direction (westward); no side views of craft; always same shape no matter my angle to them; the two maintained exact distance from each other, a mile or more apart. i was surprised and curious but not fearful; thought \u201cthey're sightseeing\u201d; sensed they could see my car lights on the dark road; wanted to pull over and observe but didn't think it safe to stop on remote, dark road, as i was alone, the wind was blowing, with only an occasional car passing in the opposite direction.\nsize of ufos: larger than jumbo jet (which has 222-foot wingspan). \naltitude of ufos: closer craft, 3,500 feet? (similar to airliner altitude when flying over city before approaching airport). second craft much higher and maybe miles away.\nend of sighting: nearing hwy 46/hwy 101 junction in paso robles, i realized they had almost imperceptibly drifted farther westward and, when i turned northward toward paso robles, i left them behind.\n\ndate of second sighting: 1/2/2018\nobserved same craft this night; same basic coordinates as reported above, except i saw two of them above pacific shoreline to my left as i traveled north on hwy 1 approaching hwy 1/hwy 46 junction. one was closer and at lower altitude (maybe 1,000 feet?). always seemingly facing me (front view, never side view of bar of lights). on hwy 46 headed east, i observed multiple, identical craft all over the sky, facing west, at vastly different altitudes and distances. on first glance one might think they're distant stars, but on closer look you see they're uniform horizontal bars of lights, hovering. i thought, even if they were some military or experimental aircraft or glider, no way would there be this many gathered in the sky at once! \nnumber of ufos: 40 or 50?\ntime/duration of sighting: 6:45 pm to 7:15 pm, pacific (30 mins.)", "duration": "00:20:00"},{"imange_name": "106.png", "reported_at": "2018-01-03", "image_tags": "flagpole, flagstaff", "shape": "Sphere", "sighted_at": "2018-01-04", "location": "Whitton,England", "text_caption": "a view of a city street at night .", "description": "Dear team, \n\ni was taking moon picture and noticed a blue light, went on to take the moon picture and can be seen on picture, then walked little bit away and took another picture. which is more clear. \n\nthis happen few minutes ago uk/london time 1:00 am , i took picture through my front door looking towards east south. my address is 191 argyle avenue, whitton, tw3 2lp.

its path seemingly effected by wind or just wavering slightly from side to side (relative to its path)  then was lost behind houses.", "duration": "00:05:00"},{"imange_name": "114.png", "reported_at":

international drive when we first saw the lights. all 3 individuals in my car witnessed this. none of the 3 individuals had taken any drugs/alcohol/excessive sugar/anything that could affect our vision or judgement. at first, we saw what looked like a very large spotlight in the sky, which wasn't too unusual being that it was new year's. the spotlight moved very rapidly in a circular motion and split up into various smaller-looking spotlights. they seemed to zoom around erratically for a few seconds, then reformed into the larger spotlight. it then broke up again and zoomed around erratically. it reformed into the larger spotlight then broke up into 10 smaller spotlights and formed a semi-circle in the sky, which then remained stationary. we arrived at our hotel and they were still visible; these smaller spotlights then remained stationary in the sky until at least 2am, when i had to (unfortunately) go to bed. they mostly stayed the same the whole time, the only change i really noticed was that over time the lights somewhat dissipated and became duller, but stayed in the exact same shape the whole time. i will attach two photos i took. i felt incredulous throughout the whole ordeal, and kept thinking, \"is this real life? are we being attacked in this new year?\" i didn't feel threatened though, i almost felt as if they were extraterrestrial, all they wanted was to observe our new year's celebration or something? it was very strange that not too many other cars or people nearby seemed to even look up or care. the lights were very apparent in the sky, i just

the grocery store with my father. as we turned the corner of redstart and warbler to get home, i noticed something out of the ordinary; a large, pulsating, bright white light. there is quite a bit of air traffic in our area, but this light was larger than any plane light i have ever seen. having no outline like a plane would at such a low altitude (about twenty degrees above the horizon, just at the tree line), this light caught my attention. when i first saw it, i observed a small blinking red light at the bottom front of the light. about a third of the way through the observed flight path of the larger light, the red light disappeared. traveling east, the light suddenly started pulsating differently from before; it started to alternate between the same bright white i had originally seen and a teal-like color. its flashing reminded me almost of a strobe light. turning away from the northeast, the large light swung around to the southeast. i watched it pulsate, fly over my house off in the distance, before losing sight of it behind the large trees in my area. the whole sighting lasted about twenty-to-thirty seconds. as soon as i got in the house, i fetched my laptop and jotted down a quick description of what i had just seen. i hadn't even taken off my coat or shoes yet; i wanted to write it down while it was still incredibly fresh in my mind.\nwhile my father was with me, he didn't see anything. he had recently had cataract surgery, so his vision was very limited, especially since it was nighttime when the sighting occurred. he didn't believe me at first, but he does now since we got a short fragment of the light on the car's dash cam. being low-resolution, i probably won't include the clip. however, a friend and i were able to get a freeze-frame of the light, along with a close-up, higher-resolution picture.  in the first picture, the light observed is in the upper right-hand side of the picture, while the larger light closer to the left is a street

yards off the blacktop i was traveling on. i remember thinking how awesome the sight was as it resembled a large vortex over the water. so i decided to pull over to the roadside and take a few photos with my phone. i walked around to the passenger side of my pickup and held my phone up and focused on the lake and geese. the instant i pressed the touch screen to capture the image, i saw a blip, or black flash out of the corner of my left eye. i remember having a strange sensation so i, in an almost frantic fashion, got back into my pickup and drove off. i didnt look at the photo i took for several hours afterward. not because i didnt want to but because it seemed to have no importance compared to that of the \"blip\". but then i looked and saw what i could not explain. i had captured on film a ufo. i have showed my photo of whatever it is to several people who have provided many different explanations but none of which are acceptable to me. i do not know what the object was. i know it was there and gone in a flash. i know it was in the sky using some form of flight and propulsion i am not aware of and i know it scared me a little. whiteman airforce base is located just to the

state park area when i said to my friend ( who i was speaking on the phone for the last 40 minutes) \"what is that!\".   i realized that there were very bright lights up in the sky moving around,( i told my friend, \"you don't believe what i just saw, something different in the sky).  i continued for another 20 seconds and then, i had to stop on the south part of the tunnels just after the curve, i stopped at the cliff and i realized that my radio ( satellite radio) stopped transmitting, so my call with my friend got disconnected ) \n\ni tried to take a picture and the light was so bright that was blinding me and i felt a little disoriented. \n\ni continued to watch these two objects:  there were both of undetermined shape to me, because by then, the sunset already has settled, so the only part that was visible was the front of the vehicles, like a rounded shape, the light emitted by these vehicles was very bright ( color was white platinum, grayish) it illuminated the pacific ocean underneath.The light hurt my brain, one of these objects was a bit smaller than the other. \nthey positioned themselves in various directions and they flew in figure eights up and down and other directions like \"interacting with each other\", in the interim, i observed  other flying objets around them but much, much, smaller like rods and tiny compare to the size of the other two (with respect of the smaller rod shaped objects, some were platinum silver color and the other ones orange).  no, going back to the two larger object emanating lights, at one point the larger ship positioned itself hovering \n( no noise) on top of the smaller one, \nthey were both separated with considerable distance, but hovering with no noise, then from the bottom of the smaller vessel there was a line of plasma or steam in a straight line that went all the way to the pacific ocean surface, ( like a column of water? steam? something!) and from the top of the small vessel there was another line of steam or \"energy\" with a bright light emaneting from it connecting directly to the bottom of the larger object. they stayed like this for a while.  \n\nafter that, they moved from this position and they interacted in different flying patterns until they disappeared in the horizon moving further west toward the direction of the  channel islands. ( not catalina,anacapa nor santa cruz islands, but the ones less known up north from those.\n\n40 minutes later, i arrived to my home in ventura county and i told my sons what had happened. \nlater that evening we heard all kinds of news about the well known vandenberg air force falcon4 spacex launched that evening. \n\nthis is what i don't understand:  i want to clarify that i  moved to the coast of ventura county in 2002, i am very familiar with the skys and the ocean in the area. i know about vandenberg and i have witnessed  the launch  of their products many times through the years.  what i saw on december 22 is not the same as other launches.\n\ntwo objects interacting with variable  patterns i just described is so different.  \n\ni also saw pics of the trajectory from phoenix az the local news channels posted on their broadcasts. \nnothing looked like my observation and pics. \n\ni would like to know what is your professional opinion.  in fact, these objects were interacting in figure eights and vertically, exchanging some type of energy or material, or water drawn form the ocean. \nthese objects were totally silent.  actually everything was crisp and strangely quiet.  \n\nwhen i arrived home, i had this headache and this mild very minimal disorientation, my son, watched the pictures i have taken on my cell phone, and that's when he realized that one of the pictures was a \"live\" pic on my iphone when i played it, we saw the millisecond video and how  basically i saw these events.  it did not capture everything, but enough to realize that nobody in the media showed these pictures.  i just don't know what happened to me, i remember searching for a good view angle, looking through the eye of the camera in my cell phone, but suddenly i feel that it's gotten darker alltogether and i did not recall having taking the picture that i discovered when i arrived at home. \ni remember that the light was so intense that was disorienting. again, i don't think i lost track of time, but still had a 'weird\" feeling about it. \n i remember that i was having problems with my iphone camera.It wouldn't focus or take the picture. \ni wish i could send you the \"live\" sequence, it's short but worth while seeing it. \n\nnote: please be aware that i have lived in the ventura and s. barbara counties throughout the last 17 of my life and i know the ins and outs of these counties. i am a connoisseur of the area., so things don't impress me as this event that i am trying to explain how could i have seen something so different than what the media is showing. \nthanks \nbest", "duration": "00:07:00"},{"imange_name": "150.png", "reported_at": "2017-12-25", "image_tags": "spotlight, spot", "shape": "Boomerang", "sighted_at": "2017-12-22",

8:16 am. \n\nmy coworker (the driver) and i were traveling westbound on i-80 towards san fransisco on our way to work. while passing the area of vacaville i noticed an object hovering over a hilltop in the distance. the size of the object would be about the size of an aspirin if held at arms length. it was cylindrically shaped (oriented vertically) it appeared larger at the top. the object was dark gray-black. it was very pronounced against a clear sky background. i saw the object intermittently as my line of sight was disrupted by traffic in the lane next to mine and an overpass that we drove under. for me, the event lasted somewhere between 1-3 minutes. i say it that way because i didn't see the object \"arrive\" and i didn't see it leave. so i can't say for sure how long it was there. \n\nduring the periods that i had a direct line of sight to the object i could tell that while stationary it was either rotating around its y axis or changing shape. the larger part on top seemed to alternate between being on the left and right side of the object. \n\nthe weather conditions during this event were relatively clear with very little cloud coverage. i would describe it as a bright and sunny california winter morning. \n\ni'm not sure what made me first notice the object, but as soon as i did my mind classified it was \"odd.\" i drive that route several times a week and am very familiar with the aircraft in that area. travis air force base is only about 15 miles from where this event took place, so seeing military air craft as well as commercial aircraft is extremely common. along with airplanes and helicopters regularly seen in the area, its also quite common to see hot air balloons. in fact the first prosaic explanation that came to mind was a hot air balloon, but thats just not what i saw. first of all its out of season for for hot air balloons in that area. usually when you see them, theres always several hot air balloons together. hot air balloons are generally brightly colored, this was almost black, and it's shape wasn't correct to be a hot air ballon. the next explanation i came up with was one of those balloons that you would see above a car dealership or a new housing development. this however doesn't seem plausible because for one, that particular hilltop doesn't really have any buildings other then a few homes. for another, the size of the thing from the distance i saw it means it had to be much larger then an advertising balloon.  \n\nseeing this object was exciting for me. full disclosure, i'm a ufo enthusiast. i generally keep an eye to the sky in hopes of seeing something of high strangeness. until now i've never seen anything that couldn't immediately be explained. i tried my best to take photos and video with my phone but it just wasn't large enough for my phone to capture it. my coworker also saw the object and acknowledged that it was indeed strange. he too said that it didn't look like \"any hot aid balloon he had ever seen.\" \n\ni eventually lost sight of the object when we got close enough to the hills to block my view. i continued to look in the direction that i thought it may be the rest of the way to san fransisco.", "duration": ""},{"imange_name": "162.png", "reported_at": "2017-12-23", "image_tags": "volcano", "shape": "N, A", "sighted_at": "2017-11-30", "location": "Taft,California",

get to exit 289. there had been a light snow that night and what seemed to be low level grey clouds almost like an ice fog covering the northern portion of the skies and below the peaks of the mountains to the east. south of there the skies had cleared and in general the cloud deck seemed to be rising. as i came around on that broad turn on i-15 just north of lehi, some motion to my left (off to the northwest as i was on that highway turn) caught my eye. \ni was astonished by what looked to be a greyish (similar in color to the cloud deck) disk with structure and a central dome pop through the bottom of the clouds. it then quickly maneuvered on all three axis as it dropped clear of the cloud deck and then went back into the cloud hole that it had punched through. once it went back into the clouds i could see some swirling clouds and also part of a cloud wall on the far side of the cloud hole. \nthe object was visible for between 5 to 10 seconds. the hole in the cloud deck lasted for 20 to 30 seconds.\ni couldn't believe what i had just witnessed! i was stunned as i continued driving on i-15. the size of the object was amazing and i would guess that the diameter of the object was on the order of 200 yards. once i reached the airport and turned in my rental car and then got checked in for my flight, i pulled out a couple of sheets of paper and immediately sketched out what i had seen and jotted my notes down as i sat in a quiet passenger lounge. i finished my notes and sketch by 11:40 a.M. that same morning.", "duration": "00:00:10"},{"imange_name": "184.png",

trying out an easy trail from las vegas to pioneer saloon in goodsprings, nv via potosi pass...Forest service road: #582. it's 30 miles and about a 3 hour trip through amazingly beautiful terrain mostly along a bunch of power lines.\n we were somewhere in the first 1/3rd of the trail and we weren't too, too far passed the last house and the boy scout campgrounds when i saw this awesome cloud formation that looked like a phoenix flying and asked to stop for a photo opportunity.  \ni believe, thinking back, that we had just gotten through this really cool crook in the road that had a \"tiny canyon\" feel to it. it really wasn't much more than a few little crooks in the road.\n i snapped a picture with my cell phone upright and then turned my cell on it's side to get the second shot; lengthwise. \n much farther down the trail i notice the 3 circles but we really didn't have the time to investigate it further(way passed that spot by then) until i'd downloaded them to my pc for a better look. \n the second picture was taken just a few seconds from the first, both through the opened window; just got the truck's windows tinted a few weeks prior so i know the window was down. 1st picture is normal and the 2nd picture held a very unique circular cloud configuration directly under the \"phoenix\"...After noticing the circles i took lots of pictures of the scenery and clouds...I have some weird spots in the clouds in a lot of them but nothing like this. \n i showed the \"phoenix\" pictures to my bf and he, nor i, has ever seen anything like this before. he's a witness to the short duration it took to snap the 2 pics. \n he wanted to keep moving because we planned to go to pioneer saloon and be off the trail before dark. we got into goodsprings between 6 and 7pm. \n

ahead of me in yelling range while her family (behind me) was equally, if not more far. as i was looking up optimistically looking for shooting stars,  i noticed an incredibly faint \u201cboomerang\u201d shaped object moving at a seemingly high rate of speed towards the south east.\n\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\n\nat first i thought it was a small single prop airplane, i see these very often at low altitude during the night where i live, as i live just south of a municipal airport just 30 min north of orem. immediately i recognized it wasn\u2019t that due to the unusual shape and distinct lack of sound and lights. i also thought it could have been some kind of atmospheric phenomena, as it was well past dusk but still with very very faint amounts of sunlight in the distance.\n\n4. describe the object and it\u2019s actions and motions in detail.\n\nthe boomerang was moving from the north towards the south-east (downtown provo) at a high rate of speed. it was boomerang shaped with \u201chandles\u201d being thicker/rounder towards the ends. the leading edge going south was the main curve with the two ends pointed towards the north. in the image i provided the object was almost exactly like that in shape and color with the white line i added to draw a crude outline of the object,, with the leading edge being faintly yellow, as if reflecting light from the city. the rest barely being seen, nearly transparent looking without one uniform color it seems.\n\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\n\nduring i felt kind on conflicted, i wanted to look at and call over my fiance but the object was so faint and quickly moving that i was afraid i would lose sight of it and miss seeing it off. as i watched it slowly fade away towards the south i didn\u2019t bother to yell out my fiance or family about my unexplained sighting immediately, i eventually caught up to my fiance and told her about it, she was interested yet skeptical as she didn\u2019t see it. after arriving back at her parents house i did some quick googling for \u201cboomerang shaped ufo\u2019s\u201d and found the image i provided (without the white line) from another site describing a similar sounding encounter in va. since then i\u2019ve been writing up this report.\n\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\n\nas stated previously, it kind of faded away as it blended into the city lights and vanished. i looked for it for a few more seconds to see if it changed course or maybe if it was just a very dim spotlight swinging back and forth, but it never came.", "duration": "00:00:08"},{"imange_name": "196.png", "reported_at": "2017-12-19", "image_tags": "kite", "shape": "Sphere",

as well. i tried to zoom to see it better but the camera did not help me that much. this is the second time i've watched this object. the first time was two and a half months ago. i watch in the same

years but never was able to capture a photo or video. this time i think i got lucky. i put my cell camera and shot a few.

because my father had his own experience within the last couple years.\ni remember waking up at about 3:30 am on top of my bed, my bedsheets were made perfectly, all the corners crisp and everything, and my blinds were pulled tightly open, and i was incredibly awake like i had to look out my window and i had a feeling in my stomach, kind of like a \"no-gravity\" feeling. i look outside in the distance directly to the west of me in my bed, and there is this very large lemon-shaped bright yellow object very slowly traveling to my left, so south. it was going in a perfectly straight path and moving at a constant speed, what i would think to be like 3 mph but was probably a little faster given the distance it was away from me. \ni just kept staring and feeling the weird feeling in my stomach like i was frozen and terrified looking at this object. there is a large pine tree past the garage outside my window, and i knew that if it went behind that pine tree and did not come out the other side i must be seeing things. i waited and waited as it slowly surfaced onto the left side of the pine tree. my best guess is that this object was around 3-5 football fields away. as it kept slowly moving south, it started moving towards the aspen tree that was in our front yard, and as it approached around some of the first branches it just disappeared completely. the feeling in my stomach was let go, i became physically less tense but then a new feeling of reality set in that made me feel incredibly fearful and scared and confused. i felt like it wanted me to watch it, like it woke me up to watch it. i was so confused why my bed was made, i was on top of all the sheets and comforter and everything, and i was very confused why my blinds were pulled tightly open. i do not know if i did that or if something else had happened that i don't remember. i know that at that time i had watched some movie on lifetime about a stalker, and i would always shut my blinds before the sun went down because i was scared somebody would crawl onto the garage and could see me through my window, so i knew i had to have closed those blinds. i also never made my bed, especially that neat, but i really have no explanation to those parts of my experience. i also remember there was no sound that i could hear from the object, and my window was closed, but i could usually hear the cars on the busy street west of my house, and i could see the lights from the cars, but during the few minutes i saw the object i don't remember seeing any cars going down that street, or my street. i know i didn't see any other objects like airplanes or anything in the sky, and it was crystal clear out that night. i do remember seeing stars in the sky. the whole experience was maybe 5-8 minutes, and it

(see attached annotated maps.) the old farmhouse that i was approaching is located between us 89 and the old highway.  about 3/4 miles or so to the south of the old farmhouse the old highway joins up with us 89.  on the night in question, i walked along the old highway road (starting form my home in town) until less than about a quarter mile from where it joins up with us 89.  at that point, i turned around and returned home by the same route.\n\nit was a very dark night, with no moon, with the stars very brilliant in a clear sky with no clouds that i could tell.  it was also very cold, and i had a warm coat on with a hat covering my ears.  i could see the constellation orion very brightly in the east not too far above the horizon, and the two stars at the end of the big dipper which line up with the north star were just to the east of a northerly direction. \n\nas i was walking to the southwest away from the town, the lights from the town and the nearby sheriff\u2019s building provided less and less light to see the road.  occasional headlights from passing vehicles on nearby us 89 at times lit up the road i was walking on, and also at times were a bit blinding.  walking near the old farmhouse was easier to see the road, as there was a bright light on a pole illuminating the area immediately to the south of the old farmhouse.  when i was at the further parts south from town during my walk, with the farmhouse light no longer visible, the road at times was very difficult to see in the darkness, and often i had to navigate the center of the road by feeling with my feet the sloping of the surface away from the crown of the center part of the paving of the road.  the starlight, however, did provide a faint outline of the edges of the road if i looked hard.\n\nas i was approaching the farmhouse (about 400 yards or so away), at the initial sighting point, i noticed some unusual lights up in the sky to my left or towards the east or southeast, and clearly above the closer foothills of the high mountains to the east of our valley.  it took a moment or two of mental processing to realize what i was seeing was not like the usual sights i have seen so often in the night sky.  when i first saw them is when they were closest, and the long string of these lights initially and impressively filled the sky or my field of vision, until the mass of lights grew smaller as they moved towards the southwest. \n\ni am very familiar with aircraft, aircraft lighting, red rotating beacons, white aircraft flashing strobe lights, etc.  i used to fly in the air force (i am now a retired officer from the air force), and i am presently building a light aircraft.  while many of the features of these lights that i was then seeing in the sky above to my left were similar to some features of aircraft lighting, the overall presentation was very unusual, and not at all like is so typically seen in the sky.\n\nthere were from 25 to 30 points of light, apparently separate from each other, following each other in single file, as they moved towards the southwest.  i tried to count them, but it was difficult to get an accurate count.  they were not in a perfect straight line as if they were all attached to some very long, straight pole, as there was some vertical alignment variation (but not much) from light to light from an absolutely straight line, but still in a very organized single file.  what was singular and unusual was that their spacing one after the other was very uniform.  in my personal air force flying experience, when aircraft fly in formation, one is not just behind another, but somewhat to the side of the lead aircraft.  these did not appear to be following any such formation, nor was it an \u201cechelon\u201d formation, with the aircraft behind slightly below the aircraft in front.  the problem with aircraft flying directly behind each other, is that the plane behind is subject more to turbulence from the prop, jet engine(s), or the wings of an aircraft immediately in front.  so aircraft formation flights are not single file.  the closeness of one \u201ccraft\u201d to the one in front in the formation i saw seemed to present a danger of a wash or turbulence from the craft in front for normal aircraft.\n\ni could see no silhouette of whatever shape these craft might have had\u2014only lights.  i tried to estimate the height and distance of these objects in the sky.  the \u201ccrispness\u201d or clarity of the lights for me made them far closer than when i see, for example, an airliner above 30,000 feet, which we see every night around here.  because of my interest in aviation, i sometimes calculate the height and speed of general aviation aircraft i see locally during the day, based on the apparent wingspan of the aircraft against the thickness of my thumb at arms length.  (i also have a degree in engineering)  based on what i have observed and calculated seeing general aviation aircraft locally, these lights seemed to be at a height of from 2,500 to 5,000 feet above the ground here, which would make the msl altitude to be from 8,000 to 11,500 feet.  the altitude where i saw these lights is very close to 5,500 feet msl.  i could not tell if the path followed by these lights prior to when i first saw them came along and above the closer foothills of our eastern mountain range, or if their path brought them over the eastern mountain range of our valley.  the eastern mountain range to our valley tops out most places around 10,000 to 10,500 feet, and perhaps a tad higher in only a few places.\n\nbased on this kind of altitude, i would estimate their speed to be between 120 and 180 mph.  they did not apparently vary in speed, and their single file formation was unchanging from when i first saw this flight of craft or lights until they disappeared without changing direction at all to the southwest.  i could be mistaken in my altitude and speed estimates, especially as i had no wingspan to measure against the thickness of my thumb at arm\u2019s length, but that is how it seemed, based on the apparent closeness of the lights and their clarity, and my previous estimates of light aircraft in the area.  stated another way, these lights seemed to have about the same apparent velocity or angular velocity as do the airliners above 30,000 feet, or perhaps a bit more apparent velocity, but not much.  clearly they were much closer than airliners at altitude.\n\nmore on the lights themselves.  each of the lights had a red pulsating light feature, virtually the same as what i know many civilian and military aircraft have, like a rotating beacon.  there were some flashing white lights, basically the same as the white flashing strobe lights that aircraft have at night.  but not every craft or light had the flashing white or \u201cstrobe\u201d lights.  it seemed that only about one in every five or so craft (evenly spaced in the formation) had the flashing white \u201cstrobe\u201d lights.  but they all had a pulsating red light.  this was pretty consistent throughout the entire formation.  \n\nthis, while unusual in practice, still seems like a large formation of military or civilian aircraft.  however, there were two other features that did not seem normal.  first of all, there were no position lights at all that i could see\u2014green on the right wingtip, red on the left, and white on the tail.  even the airliners above 30,000 feet have position lights that i can see on a clear night, and the night of december 9 here was very clear.  but these had no position lights at all that i could see.  \n\nsecondly, these craft were totally and utterly silent.  i stopped walking two or three times when no trucks or automobiles were near, took off my hat, and tried to listen carefully.  no noise at all.  no jet noise, no engine noise, no prop or helicopter rotor noise.  no noise at all, and with no cars or trucks around, it was otherwise very silent.  even the high airliners are audible, though seeing them does precede their jet noise by several seconds.  but these lights had no noise associated with them at all, and as stated above, they clearly were much closer than an airliner.\n\nas i continued my walk to the south, and the formation of lights finally disappeared in the distance in the southwest, i then noticed a second formation of the exact same lights, with all the same features and descriptive elements, following the exact same path the first had taken, until they finally disappeared in the distance in the same location.  the only difference is when i counted the lights in the second formation, i counted between 12 and 14 total, or about half as many as in the first formation.  again, each had a pulsating red light, and every five or so had a flashing white \u201cstrobe.\u201d  the second formation was identical in all ways to the first, except in size or number.\n\ni finally reached my turn around point in my walk as described above after the second formation disappeared.  i didn\u2019t see any more of the same lights, but i did see a few other lights which were definitely aircraft, virtually all of these others airliners.  typical aircraft lights and appearance were not at all like the two formations that i saw that night.  \n\nthe next night i repeated the same identical walk as the previous night, but did not see again any of the unusual lights described above, only that which were clearly normal aircraft.  the night and atmospheric conditions the second night were identical to the previous night when i saw the formations.\n\nmy first impression was that i was seeing a large formation of military helicopters carrying troops on some kind of exercise.  but then for several reasons above, this didn\u2019t seem to add up in my mind.  we do occasionally have military helicopters fly over our valley in the day, and they make an awful racket.  even slightly higher up as i estimate these lights to be (somewhat above the altitude that i have personally seen military helicopters above our valley), i can\u2019t imagine that one wouldn\u2019t hear a military helicopter\u2014especially a large formation of them of one to two dozen.  it also occurred to me that these lights might have been objects being towed by a lead aircraft, but in contemplating the formation, it was far, far too long for this to be the case.\n\ni have studied the phenomenon of ufos considerably for over 25 years, have read dozens of books on them, and have even written on the subject.  i attended one day of a mufon convention once in albuquerque.  i have personally met and corresponded with stanton friedman, and personally met and spoken with kevin randle, don schmitt, phil klass, and others.  phil klass impressed me very much as being very disingenuous in his debunking work.  i sat next to him during the mufon convention, and it was a wonderful experience to witness his methods.  i became utterly convinced after having met him and interacted with him for a little while that he knows exactly what he is (or was\u2014god rest his soul) doing.  i have followed steven greer\u2019s work closely, and i have taken the critical course on this whole subject in my mind, that while i\u2019d love to know the truth of it all, above all i want to be rational about it, and not jump to unwarranted conclusions, or fall victim to emotion or sensationalism.  i have never seen a \u201cufo\u201d in the classical sense myself, though i have spoken with many people who have.  \n\ni would tend to think that what i witnessed the other night has a mundane, though unusual explanation, but i would really like to know what these lights might have been.  as mentioned above, my first glimpse was quite impressive, as the string of lights occupied pretty much my entire field of view.  any help to determine just what i saw the other night would be very welcome.  thank you so much.", "duration": "00:25:00"},{"imange_name": "229.png", "reported_at": "2017-12-13",

the sky hovering above the tree tops. i kinda brushed it off at first as low flying helicopters, but as the minutes passed i noticed the lights were not moving and were hovering in place. there were 3 of them and they were pure white and seemed to be pulsating simultaneously. they didn\u2019t flash like helicopters or airplanes. no blue or red blinks. they would move up and down, left and right but never moved forward and always kept a triangular shape. at this point it started to creep me out and i turned to my step son who is 13 and told him to look. we continued to watch them and try to figure out what they were. as we were watching them they turned from 3 objects to 4. i don\u2019t know if one was behind the other and came out or if it came out of the other orbs. two of the orbs were very bright white while they other two seemed to be more faint. i took out my phone and snapped 2 pictures. the objects were far away from me so i had to zoom in and my phone didn\u2019t capture

shaped flame craft.  the top half was fan shaped and very bright red/orange in colour.  the bottom half was a very very bright white. \n it travelled in a straight line across the sky. i could see it clearly over the roof tops of the houses opposite me. in the light reflection of the flame shaped red main craft, i then caught sight of another very large grey looking roundish shaped craft below,

craters on the curves of the moon with my 83x retractable zoom. this time the really bright light was bouncing off the surface of it. this made the autofocus on my camera go back and forth, and every time it did this it would create what looked like a shadow on the side of the moon. this made the bright object show every time too. finally i figured out a way to zoom in on the object, and then i snapped these four pictures. \n\nthe 1st picture shows an orange glow coming from it.\n\nthe 2nd picture shows what looks like the object changing its shape. \n\nthe 3rd pictures is the most interesting one because it looks like a reentry capsule with its circular heat shield. some think it might be a lunar probe with the extension on it.\n\nthe 4th picture looks like it might have some heat coming out of it like the first but not as intense.\n\nwhy did i only snap 4 pictures? well, because i figured they might be a waste of time, and that i'd probably delete all of them anyway due to the object being nothing at all.\n\nit wasn't until i put them on my laptop that i said \"wow... what the heck is that?\" now i wish i had snapped more pictures of it, and maybe a short video too,

when the object was first sighted. i saw it after i came into my room after putting the dishes away, and there was this really bright light outside my window-it wasn't *right* outside my window- location-wise, it was over the apartment complex across from my window, and behind it distance-wise. it was in that area, and it was this really, really bright, steady light, it wasn't pulsing or flashing, there wasn't any red lights with it like a plane would have, and it was completely still. i noticed it right when i came into my room because it was so bright, it stood out against the skyline. for a second there i was like \"wait, did they have like a radio station there or something that i missed?\". i know radio stations/telephone towers aren't that color, and they flash, and it looked bigger than that, but i thought maybe it was something like that because it was so bright, and because it wasn't moving at first i thought that it was man-made. i could see the rays of light emanating from around it. but it was just sort of a steady, bright light for a second, and it stayed like that for a couple seconds but then afterwards it just sort of gradually started to dim until it was completely gone. there wasn't any other sort of flashing, and it stayed in the exact same spot the entire time- it wasn't moving or anything. when that first cycle happened i was like \"wait what, wait what?\" the whole time, i was just sort of like whispering to myself because i didn't know what i was seeing. but then a few seconds later it sort of reappeared? i'm guessing that it was the same thing because it was that same bright, white light. it didn't have any flashing effects or anything, it was just white light, and it seemed a lot dimmer or further away this time. i think it was just dimmer, i think it was probably about the same distance from me, and it was a bit towards the right, so it was heading towards the tree line, and it was sort of bobbing up and down. it sort of looked like it was in the ocean, almost? it was moving in a very fluid path, and there didn't seem to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how it was moving. so i started trying to get my phone out at that point, but it was too dim for it to pick it up, because the video recorder on it isn't the greatest. it was too grainy and dark to see anything and by the time i actually had it out it was already in the tree line. and like, i could still see it with my eyes, but my phone wasn't picking it up. i could see the light being covered up behind the parts of the sky with trees, it was definitely an object in the distance, not a reflection. so it bobbed around for a few seconds until it either turned its lights off again, or just disappeared behind the tree line. i stayed after a few minutes to try and see if i could see it again, but i didn't. it was dusk at the time and the only clouds in the sky were a few contrails. after i saw it i was pretty shaken, but i made a recording of me recounting what i saw pretty much immediately after it happened, and the majority of this text comes from that directly (i don't know how to upload that to my computer though). after that i made a quick sketch (included). it was hard for me to focus on anything and my heart was racing, but i think that was less \"supernatural abilities\" and more just me freaking out. it was weird

was a \"super moon,\" i decided to check it out down at the beach a block from my residence in ponce inlet, florida.  i accessed the beach from the parking lot that feeds from ocean view avenue along south atlantic avenue.   i was actually in conversation on my cell phone.  the view of the ocean with a full moon was spectacular to say the least, so i put my friend on speaker while accessing my camera.  i took 3 photos while continuing my conversation.   the first shot was a vertical one.  the 2nd and 3rd were horizontal.  there is a noticeable beach sign in the pictures.   by the time i took the 3rd, you can see the perspective has changed from the first two because i was walking and snapping at the same time.  \n\nit wasn't until i got home and looked at the photos were i noticed something peculiar.  in the first shot, i immediately thought it was ruined due to some kind of blemish (the unidentified light below the moon) and quickly moved to the second image to perhaps send this out to a friend or two.  because i liked the vertical style of the first shot, i began using my phone's editing feature to re-crop the 2nd one when i noticed again what appeared to be a blemish but this time, it was on the horizon.  (only seconds after the first shot.) in checking the 3rd image there was no \"blemish.\" \n\nupon further examination of the photos, i realized that the very dramatic and heavy clouds were obviously blocking starlight.  as anyone can see, the moon is barely bursting through.  and given that i didn't use a flash, it seems that the orbs present in the first 2 photos were indeed in front of the cloud cover.  i ruled out any meteor because there is no tail at all.  and the color of the orb/orbs is the same.  as for a plane or helicopter, the timing doesn't make sense nor does the type of light.  \n\ni then tweaked the photos more in my phone app and whatever it is i captured looks to be in the same sky as the moon.  additionally, i was able to pull out a second orb in the first photo but i didn't save it.  i still cannot replicate what i did.  but i would welcome anyone to tweak the 1st original and you may get lucky and see another orb down and to the left of the obvious one.  \n\nso here, i'm including a total of 5 photos.  the first 3 originals.  and then the first 2 tweaked to highlight whatever this/these lights are.", "duration": "00:00:08"},{"imange_name": "256.png",

look at the stars but i saw a couple lights flashing so i thought it was stars but i took my phone out to try n see better and i saw crazy movements so i knew it couldnt b no airplane or jet or a helicopter and it was definitely no star.So i started taking pics and videos. it seems they (extraterrestrials) can send some kind of interference since my camer is clear but when teying to rwcord them or take a pic it gets blurry almost impossible for the phone to focus and get a good image of it.When i came up to the conclusion that it had to b ufos i got goosebumps even when teying to explain to my family i would stutter cause i couldnt believe what i just witnessed.Ao ever since that night i go outside to see the sky and im not gona lie or dont think im crazy but ive been seeing them every night till dis day but on nov 28 around 1am is the best evidence i have yet.I was recording the moon cause i had a strange feeling ao i did and by the way i was smoking a cigarette like i always do late at night. the moon was vreyish bluish like a waining crescent moon and as an 1hr or so passed by it started getting lower and it went from bluish greyiah to yellowish. and im trying to get the best focus on my camera phone and i can see sum objects to the side and infront.So im still recording.And im shaking its hard not to shake or tremble when witnessing this stuff. ita getting lower and more dark orange then i can see how it wasnt 1 big bright light but like a circle with lights over it and around it and it lookes in the video like it sbrinks and then out of nowhere it dissapears.Before it disappeared tho i could see a diamond shadow a little higher which is where thw object seemed to go when it vanished as if it camaflouged or idk.I just know ive been witnessing lots of ufo action and a couple other friends have as well after i told them to pay attention at the sky.Idk why they are here or whats going on but i thought it was gonna be cool seeing a ufo but really its scary not knowing why ive been seeing so many whats their purpose. i may sound crazy cause i know i probably wouldnt believw if somebody told me this but i swear on my sons life that is nothing bjt the absolute truth.The video in youtube ufos in dallas tx nov281am i didn't back it up in my phone n now os deletes i guess but i put sum other pics and videos that i got as well on the

cloud that had some rainbow colours but the other clouds were not affected. it was daylight and the sun was showing up. there was blue skies and sections with many clouds. there was no rain at all on that day. no signs of rain in my area, no thunder or lightning. within a few minutes that weird cloud completely detached itself from the surrounding clouds and dropped bellow them. once fully detached the colours became very sharp. the coloured piece of cloud was so weird and beautiful that i ended up stopping by the side of the road 2 or 3 times to take pictures with my iphone. at some point that \"cloud\" was completely detached and was not moving like the other clouds. it stood still, hanging low in the sky. i took many pictures but i did not take a video of it. it was barely moving so... no need to film. or so i thought! after, i had errands to run and forgot about this event until my memory card was almost full... that is 3 months later. so, on november 27th i went into my pictures to clear some in order to create more space on my phone's memory card. seeing how cool that cloud was on the pictures i decided to send them to a friend of mine to have a look at that cool event.\n\nlooking at the photos on my phone i only thought the round thing was a bird flying by. i am into ufos and did not want my enthusiasm to make me see only what i wanted to see. so i rationalised it at the time. but my opinion changed when my friend was looking at them on her computer and she mentioned that there was some things in the sky that were unusual. so, looking at my pictures on a computer screen we both think there is at least one ufo on a few of the pictures with that weird coloured cloud. maybe up to 5.\n\ni never noticed anything but the bizarre cloud while i was taking the pictures. i wish i had, but i was very focused on it.\n\nwe are pretty sure that there is at least one ufo on the pictures. as it is round, perfect circle within another circle. this one we are pretty certain is not a bird flying by. also, it appears that there was two others that were in formation farther away and maybe 2 more.\n\nthis weird \"cloud\" was a real oddity in itself as it was not moving like\nthe other clouds. this cloud lasted about 35 minutes! i wish i had\nnoticed the ufos then to film them but i guess it was not meant to be.\n\nthe pictures were taken with my one year old iphone se. if you look at\nall my pictures you will see that my lense was clean. also, i will join all the original pictures unaltered and a few that i adjusted the contrast and exposure, and circled the possible ufos.\n\ni may never know what all these were but i can say that i found this very unusual and very \"cool\".\n\nhere are the coordinates of the field where the ufos showed up:\n\n     45.229400, -74.804832\n\ni have a few more pictures but was not able to upload them. please contact me if you are interested. thank you.", "duration": "00:35:00"},{"imange_name":

dinner.\n\nthe iss was the best i've ever seen. the body was illuminated and the solar panels were to it's sides one to the north and one to the south folded like wings. i had parked the car in the east gate shopping center parking lot and tried to get a better view with my small binoculars, they didn't help so i grabbed my large 50mm binoculars from the trunk and couldn't focus in time.\n\nafter the iss had departed to the east north east and was going out of sight i went in to mr. wonton's to pick up my food which i had called in.\nonce outside at my car i called my friend who alerted me to the iss. as we were talking he asked if i saw a second object traveling with or beside the iss and i said no.\n\nthen to the east, directly east of the shopping center at 30 degrees i saw an object that looked like the iss! it had the same appearance which is very unique except it was low 500 feet or lower and its body was illuminated cherry red in an hour glass shape. the white portion was exactly like the iss solar panels. it was in slow flight, not hovering. i told my friend and don't know if i described it i was so excited. \n\ni don't know what it was. it was unlike any airplane or helicopter ive seen\nand my binoculars were in the car. i couldn't take my eyes off it except for an instant when i told my friend i'll try to capture it on the iphone.\n\nthe photo did not turn out all i could get was a bright light in the sky higher than street lights.\n\ni watched the object for several minutes till it receded from view. i got in car thinking maybe i could chase it but realized it was already a mile or so away and chasing it in suburban traffic would be fruitless.\n\ni can later do a sketch of the object and perhaps find a map to download.", "duration":

"Br\u00fcggen,Nordrhein-Westfalen", "text_caption": "a traffic light with a street sign attached to it .", "description": "The event took place at approximately 10:14 pm on september 21st, 2017. i was driving home from my volleyball practice on a rural road called \"happelter heide\" near the village of br\u00fcggen (postal code 41379) in germany. i was listening to music, and my driving speed was approximately 100 km/h. when i was randomly looking outside my left window, i noticed a bright light in the sky (for the exact location, please refer to the map i uploaded as picture). i was immediately wondering what this light could be. it was significantly bigger than a star, but just a bit smaller than the moon. i could not see any structural components of the flying object, all i could see was a very bright, white light that seemed to be triangular in shape (could have been three lights in the corners of a triangle that were so bright that it looked like one big light). as mentioned, the light was white in color, even though there was a very very subtle colorful pulsating shine in it. it reminded me of a very subtle nacre-effect. the object did not have any kind of emission. i was really stunned for one moment because this object seemed to be so strange and remarkable that it made my brain stop working for a second. i had a look on the street again, to make sure, i'm not going offroad while watching the object. when i looked back at the object, i noticed that it was flying on a 9 o'clock position from me. it seemed to have the exact same speed than i did (still around 100 km/h). it gave me the impression that this object is observing me, as it completely matched pace with me, and flew exactly at 90 degrees left from my driving direction. in terms of altitude, i can only say, it was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon (definitely lower than 45 degrees). it did not increase or decline altitude. it was very hard for me to identify the actual altitude and size of the object. either it was really far away and quite big, or rather near and smaller. due to it not changing position relative to me, the perspective really didn't allow to make assumptions on distance from me and its actual size. the motion was steady and smooth, as i said, it was going exactly as fast as i did. i could not hear any sounds, which might have been because i was inside the car and listening to music. the ufo did not land. no entities have been seen. while i saw the object, i felt amazed and shocked at the same time. as mentioned before, for a short moment, i really kind of froze, and was not able to do anything than look at this object. overall, i would describe the experience as exciting. around 10 seconds after i saw the object for the very first time, it disappeared behind the trees of a small forest that lies next to the road (see map for more details). i tried to check for the object several times after that, but i could not see it anymore. my first thought about this object was, that it could have been a drone. however, some reasons make me doubtful about that. first of all, why would someone use a drone in pure darkness above a large corn field? secondly, the lights just seemed to be too bright, to be part of a drone. though i cannot remember that the lights really lightened up the area, the seemed to be almost a bit blinding (like a very strong floodlight beam taht you look into directly). thirdly, the movement of the object is making me feel doubtful. sure, there are drones that can fly much faster than 100 km/h, but also the smoothness and steadiness and the exact pace of the motion felt kind of unreal. \ntherefore, i decided to file a report about this sighting.", "duration":

4 hours of each other. i am not sure what these objects are.  photo stc0219 looks sort of like a weather balloon, but if that's what it is - it appears to be drifting against the prevailing winds, which are normally from the nw - not the se.  i'm not even sure anyone would release a weather balloon this far from anywhere.   stc0680 and stc0681 are within the same minute.  first - there was nothing - then this dark disk.  again, it looks like an orb but it certainly wasn't around for long - a balloon would have been captured in multiple frames.  stc 0207 and stc 0247 are also disks - could they be drones?  i don't know - if you compare them to the transmission lines those poles are tall and wide - perhaps 40-50 feet apart.   if that's any reference i would suspect the round objects must be at least 30 feet in diameter, and the 'lazy triangular' object in photo stc0219 would indicate to me that is larger than 50' across and even taller.  i waited several weeks to download this game camera, and was rather surprised to see all these objects in the sky within 4 hours of each other.  we do have a commercial rotary wing aircraft that occasionally flies over.  i suspect it

astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object\u2019s lights didn\u2019t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus\u2013the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn\u2019t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn\u2019t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn\u2019t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\nthey flew in a controlled fashion\u2013they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn\u2019t know how they flew\u2013and didn\u2019t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn\u2019t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don\u2019t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn\u2019t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures\u2013snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn\u2019t see anything when the witness took these photos. \nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky\u2013maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn\u2019t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around\u2013sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn\u2019t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport\u2013about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone\u2013the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns\u2013several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren\u2019t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don\u2019t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft\u2013just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object\u2019s blinking. \nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn\u2019t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out\u2013the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\nthe witness wasn\u2019t sure about the colors\u2013whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns\u2013nothing like an airplane. \nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn\u2019t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn\u2019t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn\u2019t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: \u201cwind    \nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \nmax wind speed         14 mph           \nmax gust speed 17 mph           \nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51\u201d\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don\u2019t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don\u2019t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked\u2013the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn\u2019t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\n\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn\u2019t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn\u2019t be some form of camera artifact.\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera\u2019s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don\u2019t more around.\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren\u2019t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn\u2019t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren\u2019t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\n\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\nthe video definitely showed some of the object\u2019s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn\u2019t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red\u2013sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn\u2019t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while\u2013the video captured them three times. the witness don\u2019t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don\u2019t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don\u2019t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don\u2019t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don\u2019t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn\u2019t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don\u2019t know if there were other colors. \nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn\u2019t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn\u2019t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn\u2019t see them again\u2013they slowed only three times. \nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn\u2019t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn\u2019t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \nno object\u2019s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object\u2019s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \n\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn\u2019t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\nthese object\u2019s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \nbecause the background isn\u2019t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  \u2013 - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 \u2013 -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn\u2019t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn\u2019t be seen. \nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (when the witness had first seen the display it was to the west of venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time the witness had the camcorder on, the witness was just photographing the tail end of the group. when the witness took the video, the witness thought it might be too late to get anything, but the witness did photograph some of it.) thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. the witness has many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.\nthe video began with a wide-angle exposure. a white light appeared at 00:00 \u2013 -00.25. it was below the moon and to the left of venus. because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the moon, venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance. \ntwo (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 \u2013 -00:23, then more flashes appeared. increased activity begins at about 00:07. one of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 \u2013 -00:17, another was at  (00:08 \u2013 -00.07), and another at  00:015\u2013 -00:10. these may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed.  one white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 \u2013 -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at  00:16 \u2013 -00.09).  at 00:11 \u2013 -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together. \nat 00:13 \u2013 -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. nothing was visible during further clicks. one trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 \u2013 -00.06.\nthe first two red objects appeared at 00:07 \u2013 -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at  (still at 00:07 \u2013 -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 \u2013 -00.18). after that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 \u2013 -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 \u2013 -00.17). the two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 \u2013 -00.16. sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 \u2013 - 00.16. at 00:08 \u2013 -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. sometimes they would form a triangle.\nboth white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 \u2013 -00.22. \nthese red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and the witness didn\u2019t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. when the witness am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, the witness see no flashing objects like this, so they weren\u2019t camera artifacts. the main time there are camera artifacts on this camera\u2019s videos is when the battery is low. these artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. they aren\u2019t flashing objects like these. \nthe witness posted this video on youtube on that day and has posted more several more times. because one could see a lot less on youtube than on the hidef video, the witness just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view. the witness also tried adding a hidef video, but the youtube ones didn\u2019t have enough pixels to show much and the witness received no comments. \nthe witness thought the iphone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when the witness took the photos and the photos were in full high definition. \nthe camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. it was a sony hdr-hc5 hdv 1080 4mp minidv hi with 10x optical zoom and digital zoom. the recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on dv cassette tape. the camera has night vision, but the witness had it set for day vision, so the witness could see the color of the planets. the video was transferred to an imac computer using imovie. the video is large, 425 mb, and the witness did not know how to send it. the youtube video upload shows much less than the actual video. \nthe witness has the original photographs that were sent from the iphone tothe computer and the tracking information. the witness thinks the gps had been turned off. \nthe photo\u2019s exif data existed. this worked and the witness was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\nthe witness used the internet program \u201ccamerasummary.Coms\u201d to extract the exif information. the photographs that had originally mailed to the computer provided a complete exif. \nthis worked and i was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\ni used the

immediately before the sighting\n\n\n/// ///\n\n\n\nbright red and white flying, flashing objects\n\n\n\nthe sighting, november 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object\u2019s lights didn\u2019t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus\u2013the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn\u2019t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn\u2019t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn\u2019t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\nthey flew in a controlled fashion\u2013they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn\u2019t know how they flew\u2013and didn\u2019t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn\u2019t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don\u2019t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn\u2019t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures\u2013snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn\u2019t see anything when the witness took these photos. \nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky\u2013maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn\u2019t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around\u2013sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn\u2019t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport\u2013about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone\u2013the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns\u2013several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren\u2019t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don\u2019t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft\u2013just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object\u2019s blinking. \nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn\u2019t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out\u2013the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\nthe witness wasn\u2019t sure about the colors\u2013whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns\u2013nothing like an airplane. \nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn\u2019t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn\u2019t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn\u2019t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: \u201cwind    \nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \nmax wind speed         14 mph           \nmax gust speed 17 mph           \nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51\u201d\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don\u2019t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don\u2019t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked\u2013the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn\u2019t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\n\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn\u2019t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn\u2019t be some form of camera artifact.\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera\u2019s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don\u2019t more around.\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren\u2019t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn\u2019t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren\u2019t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\n\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\nthe video definitely showed some of the object\u2019s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn\u2019t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red\u2013sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn\u2019t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while\u2013the video captured them three times. the witness don\u2019t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don\u2019t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don\u2019t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don\u2019t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don\u2019t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn\u2019t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don\u2019t know if there were other colors. \nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn\u2019t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn\u2019t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn\u2019t see them again\u2013they slowed only three times. \nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn\u2019t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn\u2019t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \nno object\u2019s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object\u2019s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \n\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn\u2019t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\nthese object\u2019s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \nbecause the background isn\u2019t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  \u2013 - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 \u2013 -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn\u2019t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn\u2019t be seen. \nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some k", "duration": ""},{"imange_name": "290.png", "reported_at": "2017-11-25", "image_tags": "digital clock", "shape": "Sphere",

sighting, november 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm est. it began while the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object\u2019s lights didn\u2019t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus\u2013the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn\u2019t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn\u2019t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn\u2019t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\nthey flew in a controlled fashion\u2013they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn\u2019t know how they flew\u2013and didn\u2019t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn\u2019t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don\u2019t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn\u2019t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures\u2013snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn\u2019t see anything when the witness took these photos. \nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky\u2013maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn\u2019t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around\u2013sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn\u2019t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport\u2013about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone\u2013the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns\u2013several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren\u2019t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don\u2019t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft\u2013just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object\u2019s blinking. \nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn\u2019t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out\u2013the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\nthe witness wasn\u2019t sure about the colors\u2013whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns\u2013nothing like an airplane. \nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn\u2019t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn\u2019t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn\u2019t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: \u201cwind    \nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \nmax wind speed         14 mph           \nmax gust speed 17 mph           \nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51\u201d\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don\u2019t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don\u2019t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked\u2013the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn\u2019t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\n\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn\u2019t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn\u2019t be some form of camera artifact.\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera\u2019s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don\u2019t more around.\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren\u2019t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn\u2019t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren\u2019t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\n\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\nthe video definitely showed some of the object\u2019s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn\u2019t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red\u2013sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn\u2019t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while\u2013the video captured them three times. the witness don\u2019t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don\u2019t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don\u2019t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don\u2019t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don\u2019t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn\u2019t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don\u2019t know if there were other colors. \nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn\u2019t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn\u2019t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn\u2019t see them again\u2013they slowed only three times. \nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn\u2019t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn\u2019t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \nno object\u2019s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object\u2019s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \n\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn\u2019t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\nthese object\u2019s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \nbecause the background isn\u2019t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  \u2013 - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 \u2013 -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn\u2019t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn\u2019t be seen. \nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (when the witness had first seen the display it was to the west of venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time the witness had the camcorder on, the witness was just photographing the tail end of the group. when the witness took the video, the witness thought it might be too late to get anything, but the witness did photograph some of it.) thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. the witness has many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.\nthe video began with a wide-angle exposure. a white light appeared at 00:00 \u2013 -00.25. it was below the moon and to the left of venus. because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the moon, venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance. \ntwo (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 \u2013 -00:23, then more flashes appeared. increased activity begins at about 00:07. one of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 \u2013 -00:17, another was at  (00:08 \u2013 -00.07), and another at  00:015\u2013 -00:10. these may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed.  one white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 \u2013 -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at  00:16 \u2013 -00.09).  at 00:11 \u2013 -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together. \nat 00:13 \u2013 -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. nothing was visible during further clicks. one trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 \u2013 -00.06.\nthe first two red objects appeared at 00:07 \u2013 -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at  (still at 00:07 \u2013 -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 \u2013 -00.18). after that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 \u2013 -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 \u2013 -00.17). the two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 \u2013 -00.16. sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 \u2013 - 00.16. at 00:08 \u2013 -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. sometimes they would form a triangle.\nboth white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 \u2013 -00.22. \nthese red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and the witness didn\u2019t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. when the witness am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, the witness see no flashing objects like this, so they weren\u2019t camera artifacts. the main time there are camera artifacts on this camera\u2019s videos is when the battery is low. these artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. they aren\u2019t flashing objects like these. \nthe witness posted this video on youtube on that day and has posted more several more times. because one could see a lot less on youtube than on the hidef video, the witness just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view. the witness also tried adding a hidef video, but the youtube ones didn\u2019t have enough pixels to show much and the witness received no comments. \nthe witness thought the iphone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when the witness took the photos and the photos were in full high definition. \nthe camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. it was a sony hdr-hc5 hdv 1080 4mp minidv hi with 10x optical zoom and digital zoom. the recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on dv cassette tape. the camera has night vision, but the witness had it set for day vision, so the witness could see the color of the planets. the video was transferred to an imac computer using imovie. the video is large, 425 mb, and the witness did not know how to send it. the youtube video upload shows much less than the actual video. \nthe witness has the original photographs that were sent from the iphone tothe computer and the tracking information. the witness thinks the gps had been turned off. \nthe photo\u2019s exif data existed. this worked and the witness was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:\nthe witness used the internet program \u201ccamerasummary.Coms\u201d to extract the exif information. the

the witness was standing in the back yard photographing astronomical objects. thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain ufos, because when it happened the witness was photographing venus, mars, saturn, and the moon and the witness labeled them on some of the photographs. the witness is an amateur astronomer, has worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, the witness had two cameras with me. the cameras were an iphone 6s and a hidef camcorder that also records sound. the witness has made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. everything the witness saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.\nit started when the witness was looking southwest at venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. they flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. there were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. the object\u2019s lights didn\u2019t blink or change in intensity or brightness. the movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. from this first second of the sighting, the witness was mystified.\nthey approached venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, the witness thought they had to be connected. the witness watched for what would happen when they would pass venus. they were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. when they went by venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full moon's apparent diameter above venus and the lower one about the same distance below venus\u2013the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with venus in the middle. they moved so synchronously that the witness expected them to be connected. although the witness couldn\u2019t see any connection, the witness thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.\nbut when they passed by venus, the witness saw no dimming, so the witness didn't know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn\u2019t show up much when they flew past venus). they didn\u2019t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. they looked nothing like chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.\nthey flew in a controlled fashion\u2013they stayed in a vertical position. the witness didn\u2019t know how they flew\u2013and didn\u2019t hear engine noises but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. the witness was amazed because they looked like something that couldn\u2019t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, the witness thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. the witness don\u2019t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.\nthe witness had been taking photos of the planets with the iphone in hand when the witness saw them. but the witness was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that the witness didn\u2019t do anything except stand there frozen. when the brain finally re-activated, the witness realized the witness needed to take photos so the witness took pictures\u2013snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 est each 5 seconds after the previous one. this was after the red objects had already passed. the witness think the witness didn\u2019t see anything when the witness took these photos. \nthen the witness noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. this display took up a large area of the sky\u2013maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. it spread from the tree to the southeast to west of venus, which was to the west. \nbecause the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, the witness ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion.  it took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. it was mounted on a tripod. by the time, the witness had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so the witness couldn\u2019t see them. the witness thought the tail end of the objects was still there. the witness pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. when the witness had seen them by eye they appeared to flash, move around\u2013sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. all this was soundless. there seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. these were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. the witness took a 26-second video (although that doesn\u2019t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).\nthe size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. a low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at john glenn columbus international airport\u2013about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the moon or smaller. the size of the moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. it shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. the car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. if the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.\nthere was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. this is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around.  the neighbors are the relatives and the witness knew what they are doing. the witness is very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.\nthese objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. the sighting was nothing like viewing a drone\u2013the witness has a drone, flies it, photographs with it, and repairs it, so the witness is familiar with drones. the objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). what the witness saw were bodies against the sky. it was nothing like fireworks. the witness has recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. this was nothing like chinese lanterns\u2013several chinese lanterns have landed in the field the witness filmed in and has them. they weren\u2019t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don\u2019t light up at night. the witness saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. the witness read that all aircraft built after march 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. there was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft\u2013just white flashes at random all over the sky. in addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object\u2019s blinking. \nthe white flashing objects were nothing like stars. when one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. but they do not completely disappear and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. the stars and planets have stable locations. thus, the phenomenon wasn\u2019t photographs of stars or twinkling. both cameras can photograph stars at night. also the witness had seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. the witness has also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out\u2013the witness may even have one that the witness collected here years ago. these last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.\nthe camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when the witness rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.\nthe witness wasn\u2019t sure about the colors\u2013whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. the objects blinked in random patterns\u2013nothing like an airplane. \nthe objects the witness watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, the witness had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. in the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what the witness captured of these were flashes. occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.\nafter the witness recorded the views, the iphone and camcorder were taken into the house and the witness e-mailed the camera photos to the computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. the witness still has the original e-mails and camcorder tape. there was a game going on at the school several miles to the west and so the witness contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. the answer was no, and the witness didn\u2019t think so to begin with but checked anyway.  later the witness called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. they said no, and suggested calling the bigelow organization that collects ufo information. they returned the call several days later, but the witness didn\u2019t get back to them. the witness immediately on november 4 posted the video both on youtube and facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but the witness didn\u2019t find out anything. the original november 4 youtube videos and other posts are still on.\nthe witness also checked the weather which said: \u201cwind    \nwind speed     4 mph (north)              \nmax wind speed         14 mph           \nmax gust speed 17 mph           \nvisibility       8 miles and from the north at 7: 51\u201d\nthe wind was blowing from north to south. the objects traveled from west to east. if the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power. \nbecause this was the backyard, the witness has taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. for example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don\u2019t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. these other videos don\u2019t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.\nimmediately after the witness made the photography, the witness wondered if  anything had been photographed, because this was difficult photography. it was dark, which made it difficult to use the iphone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. but when the witness uploaded everything to the computer, the witness was amazed that everything had worked\u2013the cameras had come on instantly and in focus. \nthe witness had taken three photos by iphone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. these three turned out well and although the witness thought the witness had photographed nothing because the witness did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and the witness didn\u2019t see anything when t the photographs were taken, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera. \nthe videotape also turned out much better than the witness expected. the witness might have seen a few flashes when the witness made the video, but the actual video showed much more. when the witness clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. the witness had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashes.\n\nwhen the witness uploaded the three photographs into the computer, the witness noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. they were generally to the east of venus. although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).\nin order to check whether the spots were in the same place, the witness made computer transparencies and overlaid them. this showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.\nin order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, the witness looked at the photos that were taken right before the witness saw the two red objects. there were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. thus, the spots didn\u2019t appear to be part of the natural background. they also wouldn\u2019t be some form of camera artifact.\nwith this camera, the witness can easily photograph such objects as mars and saturn and has even photographed dimmer objects such as neptune and asteroids, so the witness was familiar with the camera\u2019s performance. the stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. the witness saw no airplanes at the time the witness took the photographs and the witness would have noticed them because the witness was looking at venus. moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and the witness would definitely have noticed. the only things the witness had seen near venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before the witness took the photographs. also, the witness doubt if the camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. the objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as mars. the trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. in addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don\u2019t more around.\nalthough the only objects the witness saw were the two red ones, it appeared that the witness had photographed several other things. because the witness had seen the red objects by eye, the witness thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. the witness think they weren\u2019t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots the witness photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.\nthus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after the witness saw the two red ones. the witness didn\u2019t see these when the witness took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.\nthese spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as mars had photographed. the witness thought if birds had photographed they would have appeared dark. thus, the witness thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.\nthe witness quit photographing with the iphone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and the witness ran to the video camera. this also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects the witness had seen before this were the two red ones. also, all the witness saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; the witness assumed the flashes were from objects that weren\u2019t visible in the dark. thus, perhaps the spots the witness saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed venus.\nthis photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but the witness may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.\nperhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that ufos will suddenly blink out or disappear.\n\nthe witness was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. the witness was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.\nthe video definitely showed some of the object\u2019s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. it also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer ones \nthe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. these were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have been other colors that just didn\u2019t photograph). these objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. the first two red objects that the witness had seen with by eye shone a very bright red\u2013sort of a blood red color. two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. however, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing. \nthe white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (the photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. the neighbors were relatives and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).\nthe witness had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. although the witness didn\u2019t see this with by eye when the witness took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while\u2013the video captured them three times. the witness don\u2019t know if these red objects were the same ones the witness saw with by eye at the beginning when they passed venus. there were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and the witness don\u2019t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. the witness had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in the original observation by eyesight but don\u2019t know if these were what the witness was seeing in the video. sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. the witness don\u2019t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. the witness had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).\nthe video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. the witness don\u2019t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two the witness saw with by eye (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed venus). these were not vertical as the ones the witness saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. these two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. the two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. if these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.\nthe witness saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.\nat other times, the witness would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. the witness couldn\u2019t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. sometimes the witness would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. the witness also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. there seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. the witness don\u2019t know if there were other colors. \nthe red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. in airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. the first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. and the time between views was less for the last one also. the distance between the red objects varied. thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft. \nother oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. their blinking pattern wasn\u2019t regular. also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. they might have been traveling upward after they had passed at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. if aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. these appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn\u2019t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. and if these were the lighting on a craft, the witness should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. but the witness didn\u2019t see them again\u2013they slowed only three times. \nin comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did. \nthese were nothing like strobe lights. although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. there was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. in comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. these white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. their strobbing wasn\u2019t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.\nthere were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. the witness didn\u2019t remember from seeing them with by eye if there were other colors. in general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly. \nno object\u2019s flashes were recorded in exactly the same place, so the witness photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. \nthere was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. in several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. the planets never appeared as double. some of the object\u2019s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. sometimes ufos are reported as merging or coming apart. these double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.\nthere were several indications that these objects had some form of power. one reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. the ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. also, they glowed and this glowing would take power. in addition, they were able to blink off and on. blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. the ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects. \n\nduring the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. the first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. venus and the moon are a distance apart. venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn\u2019t really move). a number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.\nbecause this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. for example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. a close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the moon. the display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the moon.\nthese object\u2019s flashes could also be compared to the general background. the witness took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. the background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. the objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches. \nbecause the background isn\u2019t white, the witness thought most of the white flashes are from objects. unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. the red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. however, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. an instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. at 00.08  \u2013 - 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. but as they continued, they became less well defined. at 00:10 \u2013 -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. on their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. then they disappeared and didn\u2019t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. perhaps they had sped off. \nthe white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. they often would appear for only one click. because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn\u2019t be seen. \nthe bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. however, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. if these objects were some kin", "duration": "00:22:00"},{"imange_name": "291.png", "reported_at": "2017-11-25", "image_tags": "nematode, nematode worm,

when taking it.  as i looked at the whole thing closer i noticed weird items throughout the picture.  all i would like is for someone to tell me if this is just birds/leaves tiny planes blurry streak, anything would help solve what the objects are...It's driving me nuts !\nplease, if you do need to speak to me via phone...Leave a message & i will return your call.  otherwise email is the best way

seen strange orbs in the night sky in the evening from our back deck. in both cases, there were two light orbs (larger and brighter than the light from stars) that hovered just above the mountain range horizon. they would bob and hover, moving both left and right and up and down, but mostly up and down, as though \"bouncing\". the movement was too extreme to be helicopters, and far too fast. after about 10 minutes of watching them hover over the forest, they would ascend upwards very quickly and then the light would disappear. the second time we saw this (a few days ago), there were multiple aircraft in the air all around them. the aircraft did not go near the orbs, but created a circle around them. there is an airport in johnson city and asheville. on this night, we saw one airplane taking a north-south flight path, but there were several other craft in the sky with blinking lights that appeared stationary, and were at a higher elevation in the sky, on all sides around the orbs. the orbs were too far away to get any good photos, or to see shape, but they did appear slightly elongated, or oval instead of round. the orbs bobbed and hovered for about 10 minutes, then slowly bobbed along the mountain horizon, following the slope of the tallest mountain range. one of them disappeared below the mountain range, and the other stayed in the sky and hovered at the peak of the range before we went inside. the section of forest behind us has very few homes, if any, since most of it is national forest, so we have little light pollution. we estimate that these orbs were approximately 2 miles away because the ridge that one of the orbs disappeared behind is about 1 3/4 miles away as the crow flies.", "duration": "00:10:00"},{"imange_name": "299.png", "reported_at":

had seen a ufo a year earlier. the weather conditions were the same as the last sighting. the air had a feeling to it that was familiar and i was compelled to drive to the location. i had a feeling i was going to see something. i parked the car so i could look at the area of sky i saw the last one in. i rolled down the side window and got my binoculars and iphone camera ready.  i was there about twenty minutes watching passenger jet traffic. i looked down at my iphone and when i looked at the sky again the craft appeared descending in a turning maneuver. it then started to ascend still turning. i took my eyes off it for less than a second to take a picture and when i looked again it was gone. very frustrating! i decided i would take some pictures of the sky anyway to see if  the camera could see what  i could not. and in one of the pictures an object was there but much further away and no longer had the brilliance it once had. i noticed the object because i was looking for it and it was bright silver and reflecting light from the low sun on the horizon. i have seen jets reflect the sun in the same way at times but the shape, maneuvering, and flight characteristics was nothing like a jet. it did not seem to be relying on the atmosphere for flight. i can\u2019t describe it entirely but it had a kind of floating flight. the object looked like an oval disc with a strange ball or egg sitting on top something like a tea cup on a saucer. they seemed to be two separate parts. like one was getting a ride from the other. it was extremely bright silver and was reflecting light from the sun. at the distance i saw it at i would estimate it to at least be the size of a\nboeing 747. the strangest thing is i knew i would see it. i could feel it in the air. the air felt the same as when i saw one about a year earlier in the same location. we had just had rain and the storm was over. the sky was clearing with very few clouds left. i even had the car positioned so well the object appeared in the center of the piece of sky i was watching through the drivers side window. even though i had the camera in my lap it was something so out of the ordinary it was almost hypnotizing. i had to force myself to try to take a picture. file #1 original picture, file#2 enlargement, file #3 three things in a row, clouds? file#4 enlargement, file #5 color

\"orange orb\" sightings over pacific, mo since 2009, some stationary, some moving [single], some moving in formations [delta].  all silent, all absolutely the wrong color to be flying in us airspace.  i'm a quality inspector for boeing and have worked on or near fighter jets, and military/civilian airbases since 1980 and have never seen the likes of the orange orbs.  the attached pic i received from my friend was so intriguing i felt compelled to post it to mufon to see if anyone else witnessed these objects.  according to the person i received the pic from, his friend and another guy were making their way back to the boat ramp after a day of deer hunting along the missouri river.  the sun had set approx. 15 mins. earlier.  looking at the bottom of the clouds in the pic you can tell that the sun is reflecting off the bottom of the cloud.  this may be just a very cool sun dog-type reflection, but i was having a hard time explaining the chevron shaped group of lights above the cloud, and the 'way too evenly spaced' beams of light coming off what appears to be the sun shining down from the cloud.  notice that the beams are apparently reflecting off the river.  apparently the event only lasted seconds and was gone, but i haven't talked to the person that took the pic personally.  the \"orange orb\" events i mentioned earlier were witnessed by multiple people, but are not documented with pictures, and a completely different event[s].  i'm unsure if the person that took the pic would be willing to talk to anyone about it, but i could ask if you'd like to get more details about the event.", "duration": ""},{"imange_name": "303.png", "reported_at": "2017-11-23", "image_tags": "terrapin", "shape": "Teardrop", "sighted_at": "2010-06-30", "location":

west. the orange light was brighter than any star or planet. coming off the light was an interesting trail of gas like material, it was coming off in a triangular or fan shape (possibly conical) there were 2 primarily bright trails coming off the top and bottom of the object that faded in both axis': between the two trails, and in the area behind the object that it left behind. it was traveling very slowly, and the trail behind it grew in size, the two brighter legs getting wider (or taller) and the entire trail extending farther behind the object, and lasting longer. the trail looked like a very fine gas, and was glowing a very similar color of orange to the object its self. it looked like plasma. i watched the object in amazement for about 20 seconds, until suddenly the light emitting the trail dissapeared, and from the place that the object vanished a shockwave propogated through the trail behind it, causing the trail to dissapear quickly, as the trail was pushed by the shockwave, it looked like a piece of cloth being blown by the wind. everything dissappeared, and then 2 seconds later the orange light re appeared infront of where it vanished, and starting from the light a trail of bright gas began to be emmmited from the light, it moved slowly across th3 sky for another 2 oe 3 seconds and then disappeared again with a second shockwave,\n\nthe object did not travel very far across the sky, maybe 30 degrees horizontally across the horizon over 20 to 30 seconds.", "duration": "00:01:00"},{"imange_name": "320.png", "reported_at": "2017-11-15", "image_tags": "traffic

the naked eye, which i thought was a star. i took two photos of this \"light\" before opening the skyview app to see what star or planet this was. the app showed everything around the light, but the light was not registering as a star or anything on the app. i spent 7 minutes trying to figure out what it was until i finally decided to stop wasting time and start taking pictures of the sunset again. when i switched back to camera mode, the light had taken on a different shape and color. it looked like a dark rose colored saucer at the top, surrounded by a glowing lighter rose colored sphere that was flat at the bottom. it looked as though the saucer may have been solid and the sphere may have been light the saucer was emitting. i thought i was seeing things, so i asked my friend to come look and she confirmed i wasn't seeing things. so, for the next minute, i took several pictures of this object as it moved from one side of the sun to the other. it seemed to get further away and then just faded away. i know what i saw and am excited about it, but at the same time, afraid that people will think i'm crazy. my brother, who also believes, told me about your website and

was the event of jupiter passing on venus, but when i checked the time for that specific event it didn't correspond to what i was seeing. \n\nso i decided to take my professional camera to take some pictures so that i would be able to zoom in the image and understand better what was happening, also because the look alike star i first saw, had changed shaped, came closer and descended to a close point to the horizon, above the sea.\n\ni start to take some pictures with the camera, sit back on my couch, zoom in the pictures and get absolutely shocked of what i see: \n\n- in the first picture, there are two ufo. one that i didn't see with my eyes because i was too focused on the light point. it was in a kind of round boomerang shape with some kind of multicolour led lights around it. i shot with a 2 seconds exposure and that object is perfectly sharp, it was static.\n\n- the second ufo (the one i saw), that is in all my other pictures, has a very bright light and some kind of green \"wing\". i lost sight of it because it simply vanished by becoming smaller and smaller, and appeared again two/three times with about 10 minutes interval.\ni wrote to my neighbour for her to look outside and see this strange thing and she saw it too.  i'm not sure it was the same because it was the 4rd apparition and it was almost an hour from the first apparition and i was feeling very dizzy, confused and drained. i knew i had evidences of what i saw and that was enough to make me feel more calm.\n\ni felt like i was seeing something very special and unique, but at the same time i felt

guess.It looked white metallic cause it seems very reflective (bright) i figured is not a planet cause its too bright and not a ballon cause is stationary. after few minutes of walking i decided to take a picture of it.Got to my destination and dont know about the object after that. when finished my shift at 3:00 pm came outside looked up again to see it and it was gone. i believe that same day

with my arm extended).  at the end of the sighting there were slowly blinking red lights on the tips of the triangle (i saw two lights and the other witness saw three).\n\n3. what did i think the object was:\nmy first reaction was that it could be a b2 bomber close to v shaped (if viewed from the bottom) in the n/nw that became more of a triangle shape (change in angle?) as it moved out of sight in the sw - however my reaction was that object was far to large (larger than my thumb with my arm extended) to be anything that you'd see in the sky and it grew dim and then brightened which a plane doesn't do.\n\n4. describe the object/actions:\nit moved roughly from n/nw to sw.  the object came in higher in the sky to the nw and then moved lower in the sky as it disappeared to the sw.  as it moved across the sky it would dim almost out of sight and you could see could see the outline/it obscured the sky/stars behind it and then fade back into view. during the 1st 10-20 seconds of the sighting there were no blinking lights on the object but in the last 5-10 seconds of the sighting there were slowly blinking red lights on the tips of the triangle shape.  it became much harder to see as it went toward the sw with the exception of the slowly blinking red lights - of which i saw two (sides?) and which my son saw three (all three corners).\n\n5. describe feelings/reactions:\nmy reaction was the object wasn't supposed to be there or we weren't supposed to see it.  i called to my son who was in the lower yard to come up to the deck which he did and he was able to see the last 5-10 seconds and his reaction was the same - that the object was to big (huge or far to close), strange obfuscation of night sky, blinking red lights and that it shouldn't be there.\n\n6. how did i lose sight:\nit moved to the sw and dropped in elevation in the sky and moved out of view/horizon.  as the object moved toward the sw three small/dim/slowly blinking red lights could be seen on the tips of the triangle shape.\n\ntwo drawings one from both witnesses attached", "duration": "00:00:30"},{"imange_name": "376.png", "reported_at": "2017-10-30", "image_tags": "sliding door", "shape":

overhead where it stopped.  it did not move for a few minutes then proceeded back to its original path. the lights then seemed to break up and some went directly east while others went to the

laughed it off so i kept silent.  there was one more person standing near me that witnessed it too.  i am not a ufo hunter and the best way i can describe it is to say that i saw a triangular

like to express i would prefer not to be contacted by telephone, but email is perfectly acceptable as a method of contact - should that be deemed necessary.\n\nso, i wanted to come forward now and report an experience i witnessed back in the (approximate) late summer of 1996/7. while walking along the beach at ardnadam / lazaretto point one late afternoon, i observed a glistening aeroplane fuselage in a typical position and not uncommon altitude in the sky, from what i could assertain would perhaps approximate around 1,000 feet above the top of the highest point of the adjacent hill top, not an entirely unfamiliar sight at least, that's what i initially thought it was on this, a perfectly clear virtually cloud-less sunny day but the events that unfolded over the following minutes however, changed that entirely. i somewhat surprisingly noticed firstly there was a distinct lack of any vapour-trail or notable trace of direction of travel as it moved very slowly on a direct course upon realizing this merited closer examination i immediately determined the colours were unlike any other metallic surface or similarily shaped structure usually associated with every day commercial aircrafts as this was gleaming with the super-reflectiveness of light on glass or a mirrored surface, there was an almost translucenct hue to the body. colours which i observed i would have to say still don't currently exist and i've still yet to see replicated. i'd almost compare it to something which is alive, something resembling the scales you'd find on a champagne coloured comet goldfish under the light of a incandescent bulb. it's appearance was that of an exceptionally highly polished chromium, copper, brass, gold and/or platinum, a multitude type of contrasts to these, are the closest assimilation i can express as a visual representation, it was all of those in one shape, so obvioulsy not a 'generic' aircraft fuselage paint you'd commonly find, i'd seen those many times and this was nothing compatible. neither was it at this point any type of helicopter as there was no kind of rotor blade noise vibration detectable. this situation was heightened when all of a sudden this object just stopped dead in place and hovered as though it co-incided with having an awareness of me noticing it. i could still make out the light cascading off the surface from the sunshine in sequences of reflective rays along the bodywork as it hung there, it remained silently motionless for a few moments, possibly a full minute or slightly more before accelarating directly upwards and in doing so, the shadows changed from my observational perspective, meaning this object had a difinitive shape to it with a distinguishable form akin to holding a plate overhead and i was clearly able to distinguish colour darkening and changing as shading and shadows were cast around the underside peripherary edge with a lower-hanging slight 'domed' external form to it becoming visible and as it climbed above all base cloud level and any reflected light from the earths surface below, continued far up into the stratosphere - where if i hadn't been focusing on it from my initial viewpoint at that moment in time, it's possible i wouldn't have noticed it all, then with a deliberate and controlled graceful long high-arching curvature shot off at a speed far beyond anything i could attempt to associate it to. having an almost animated or 'cartoonish' quality to it and just like that, it was completely gone in well under a couple of seconds, thousands of miles away in an instant with no visible trace of it previously even being there at all. the memory will always live with me i wasn't concerned, quite the contrary, i felt exceptionally lucky, it was a memory i cherish and it had such a profound effect on me that i am able to recall with such clarity over 20 years later. i was the only one present there and i don't recall even hearing a single vehicle during the entire time. i returned home and recanted the story to my parents and really didn't think much else of it, that was until the local paper reported others witnessing identical happenings in the local police reports column that week. (that may be worth pursuing for research purposes as records with both the police and the local paper should still exist and be relatively easily traceable and it may well serve to substantiate my account but obviously i'll leave that to your discretion) what's most intreguing here is that this occurred directly over a former site the us navy occupied from the late 1960's to the late 1990's - this took place merely a few weeks after their departure from the region. i wondered if there could be a correlation as just a random coincidence didn't seem likely given the definitive synchronicity and timeframe of this particular encounter.\n\nas to why i didn't come forward sooner, many reasons. having both the time to dedicate and consciously deciding to actually attempt recounting everything from memory and compile it in a coherent way hasn't necessarily been afforded to me as well as the fact this record is highly personal to me and i haven't felt like i wanted or maybe wasn't ready to disclose it at all, until now. i have also moved around considerably over the years and most importantly when this encounter took place it was long before the age of mobile phones or phones with camera's, even the advent of the age of the internet for that matter. i obviously didn't have anything with me at the time (and believe me, i still rue the day for not having anything with me) but it was intended to be nothing more than another leisurely walk along the shore to me, i couldn't ever have imagined it would have involved a quantifiably life-altering experience at that particular moment. i also only recently learned of mufon's existence and thought now may be the opportune time to reach out and report this in an 'in-depth' style and pass this on to you. i understand a considerable time has passed but i still feel what occurred that day holds a definitive certifiable validity. \nit may be worth mentioning, apprently that particular area has accounts of activity prior to my testimony. there is i believe even still to this day, a video uploaded on you tube of an event during the night recorded by some visitors to the town some years back.\n\ndue to the sensitivity of my position working here within the state department, i'd kindly request that any and all contact be handled discreetly. i'd be more than willing to follow up with any other information as per your request. should the need arise for any interviews face to face, i'm sure accomodations could be mutually arranged within a convenient neutral environment. -\nmany thanks for listening.",

lights, constant speed.  size, altitude and speed were hard to judge.  if i'm wrong about one, i'm likely wrong about them all.  i estimated roughly 15,000 feet high, similar speed or slightly faster than an airliner, possibly similar wingspan as a common airliner.  my first reaction was it looked like an airliner minus the fuselage and lights.  it was flying from east to west, was almost directly overhead, appeared very flat on the bottom, no contour or variation.  having been around aviation my whole life and lived with a father who wrote for aviation week for 22 years, my impression is it was an aircraft, not alien.  i admit that the conditions could've played tricks on me but that is my best interpretation.", "duration": "00:00:07"},{"imange_name": "394.png", "reported_at":

attended a guided bus tour to the old moss plant location witnessed 3 silent unknown objects pass overhead moving west to east, silently, at a very high altitude. i first noticed a small star-like round light brighter than other stars visible in the sky at that time perhaps 35 to 45 degrees up from the horizon, the yellow/white star-like light moved eastward slowly and silently, it had no flashing or blinking lights and was constant in illumination - i at first thought this could be the iss or a satellite so just maintained eye contact as it passed slowly overhead. as the first light passed over head, a second group of lights appeared behind the lead star-like object. these new lights that appeared were all solid light blue and flashed on one after another until some 8-10 lights had come on, then went off and began flashing on again one after the other repeating the sequence. moving as one group as if these light blue lights were attached to a larger object, following after the lead star-like object in a moment one could make out there were two \u201csets\u201d of light blue lights one on each \u201cside\u201d forming a disc shape, each \u201cside\u201d of lights followed the same sequence of coming on one light after the other until all were lit, then would go out to start again. at this point i shouted to the remaining bus tour group around me to look up (as it seemed obvious this was something very strange, and of interest). as the second object moved off after the first object silently, a third object appeared - it however was more of a blob of light forming a roughly arrowhead-like blobby shape of yellow-white light (it too was silent, but had no flashing/blinking lights - the light was a constant yellow-white). i recall one tour guest who was witnessing this with me commenting he believed an object was triangular shaped \u201cyou could tell\u201d he remarked, just before it entered the clouds. there were thin clouds and some thicker ones in the sky that night. overhead to our position where the second and third objects appeared to trail after the lead star-like object there were some wispy clouds. the objects trailed one another and moved off eastward. the last tour bus arrived to take the remaining group of us back to woods harbour community centre, when i boarded the bus i checked my iphone to note the time and it was 8:02pm. myself and one group of fellow witnesses had an animated discussion about what we saw on the way back to the community centre. i know at least 4 other people, other than myself witnessed this event (there is a good chance more witnesses exist).\n\nprior to having witnessed the objects, canadian coast guard were shooting flares up into the sky from ship not far offshore from our position and using a searchlight to re-enact in a small way the october 4, 1967 search for the object that crashed into shag harbour. a 50th anniversary shag harbour witness (lorne) was throwing flares into the water, and an rcmp cruiser was on scene with lights flashing. this activity had ceased aprox 10 minutes prior to the objects witnessed.", "duration": "00:07:00"},{"imange_name": "400.png",

draw to an unusual object travelling south to north, long and thin and rectangular in shape (apx 10/12 x long as wide) with a blunt leading edge, and very bright white in colour. it appeared solid but did not seem to glow or reflect the sun, with a constant speed apx 3/4 times as fast as the aircraft i had previously been watching (therefore if an aircraft would be travelling at just over 200 mph on its assent after take off, i would estimate its speed at about 500 mph +). it had no wings and made no noise, and the rear of the object seemed to shimmer/flicker or 'flap'/phase quickly as it moved. i could not make out any visual markings, and oddly it appeared 'ribbon' like (ie: no light or shading for its sides to indicate a 3d shape to it) and i had no visual reference to determine how high the object was, however it appeared to be longer than the aircraft i had been previously been watching. \n   i drew my wife's attention to it and we both watched it pass from the south, directly overhead heading towards and over the disney park in a northerly direction in a straight trajectory. i stood up and watched it as it heading over toward the park and beyond, until it disappeared into the horizon. the event took apx 50 seconds. \n   the sky was clear with no clouds and the sun dipping behind some trees which cast some shade over the veranda to the west.\n   i confirmed that my wife

see than the photo i\u2019d sent him. this guard advised me that he\u2019d seen the object  for about 30 seconds before it  did a \u201cj loop\u201d and shot off to the southeast. this guard advised me that when the object left it appeared as if a shooting star or a comet, similar to the objects photographed and video-taped over  salt lake city between 09/15/17 and 09/17/17.\ni had work to do inside the building so i wasn\u2019t able to observe the object after 0930. when i was next able to check at approximately 1020, i could no longer see the object, apparently because it had moved to the north and east of my location. this means the object remained in the sky over the valley for 4.5 hours.\na little about my background. i was a police officer for 9 years prior to becoming a security guard. i also have a military background. i do consider myself to be a trained observer with a lot of experience. the other guards who witnessed have varying levels of experience, one has military experience, the others are experienced security officers and also trained observers.", "duration": "04:30:00"},{"imange_name": "419.png", "reported_at": "2017-09-27", "image_tags": "barn",

larger than any star in the sky. it was larger than any visible planet. as i watched it i noticed it was moving. with the help of the leaves, i could tell the pace of the movement more easily because it disappeared behind the leaves. it moved faster than stars in the sky, but much slower than airplanes, sattelites, etc. so, i grabbed my good camera and tripod and ran to my back porch.\n\ni found openings between leaves and branches by standing, kneeling and in between then adjusted my tripod, zoomed in 30x, and began snapping pictures. it seemed to first be moving upwards in the sky. so i would have to adjust my tripod higher up. then it started on a slow path downward on what i believe is about 150-160 degree angle. eventually it seemed to stop and go straight downward at a 90 degree angle for the remainder of the sighting. i ended up having my tripod go from all the way down, then all the way up, then all the way down again. \n\ni almost felt like the object wanted to observe something on the ground, maybe the nearby airport, or maybe the nasa glenn research center, both a few miles south of the objects. it moved slow enough for most to not think twice when seeing it, maybe thinking it is just a large bright star. although it was definitely larger and closer than even the largest star that can ever be observed in the sky. i have been studying ufos and e.T.S for a year now, so i definitely noticed that i was seeing something different here. i see things all of the time but this is by far one of the coolest sightings i have had.\n\ni focused on this object that usually remained red and blue in the pictures pulsating fast in a pattern of red, white, blue. what i found very strange, were these smaller copper/silver colored objects that appeared in the photos i was taking near the main ufo. i did not see these objects myself at all, but they were obviously there. then i noticed another object very similar to the main one i was already snapping photos of. this one however, seemed to be blinking fast between the main colors of orange, white and yellow rather than red, white and blue. the last photo attached is of the orange and yellow object.\n\ni observed these objects between 2-3am. if i held a ruler in the sky, the object moved over a foot within an hour. i do not know of a man made or known space object that moves at that rate and looks like the pictures i have attached. the whole time i felt i was looking at something really special.", "duration": "01:00:00"},{"imange_name": "431.png", "reported_at": "2017-09-24", "image_tags":

anticipation of the weekend and the end of winter had me and everyone else at work that day in good spirits. even though it was still quite a blustery/breezy day with patchy cloud, the sun was out and i could feel it's warmth through the window directly in front of me - something i'd not felt since mid october 2016. i am quite an aviation geek so the reasonably clear skies were giving me the perfect opportunity to spot air traffic. i looked to up to my right (south,south west) and noticed 2 objects stationary and hovering - quite a distance and altitude from where i was. after a short observation, i realized they weren't helicopters as they had no appenditures or rotors or visible form of propulsion - and were a solid disc/ord/ball shape. i then thought they may be weather balloons but maintained a constant fixed position and were uneffected by the wind/breeze that was moving the clouds around them. they drifted slightly further apart then closer together but maintained the same high altitude and distance from me. i alerted my colleague sat to at the desk to my left - i picked up my iphone 7 and started taking their pictures (i have quite a few pictured of them) - i then moved from the ground floor of and up to the next floor to get a better look through the larger windows at the top of the stairs - i then captured a 30 second video. my next step was to proceed back to my desk to grab a samsung camera with a lot better zoom capability and go outside into the open - so now with samsung camera and iphone in hand, me and my colleague as headed outside to get a better view, however the objects were now obscured by cloud. we waited around about 5 minutes for the cloud to pass but the objects had gone. i have on my phone the 'flightradar24' app and there were no aircraft in their immediate vicinity - where i work is very close to the take off and approach flight path for manchester airport. the only flight in the area was an air austria embrear which we had to the east on approach to manchester airport which passed right above us whilst we were outside trying to spot the objects. the objects are definitely unidentified to myself and my colleague and if they were man made are not of standard propulsion or shape. the way they were unaffected by their surroundings (weather/clouds) and their ability to move apart and closer to each other suggested they were under intelligent control - however i am still sceptical of what i saw and i'm unconvinced that it is evidence of a space fairing race of aliens.", "duration": "00:03:00"},{"imange_name":

year now. i look into the sky each time i have the chance because i know of the amazing things occurring above my head all of the time. what better time to view the sky then during a beautiful sunset. i decided to use my step father's high quality binoculars to see if i could see anything small, more clearly, if anything at all. after viewing a few planes, a couple high up with paths and another low enough to see the full body and wings, i suddenly came across something very large and oddly shaped. it was the spitting image of a chrome/gray/black tri-bead. (if you google tri-bead you will see what i am speaking of). i was surprised to even see a hole, or light in the middle of the ufo, just like the hole in the middle of a tri-bead. i only saw the ufo for a few seconds. maybe it had been there longer and i caught the end of the sighting. maybe it knew i was looking for something and appeared for me just long enough for me to be in awe. this was over the lake, just touching cloud cover. the tri-bead shaped ufo seemed to be on a slant. like if you took a tri bead and turned it so you could see the bead from the side view rather than above. then slightly turned it so that you could see the side of the tri-bead but also view some of the top of the bead as well. it moved at a 135 degree angle in the sky. it was an odd movement, like it was floating but moving fast, but not too fast. the movement reminded me of a balloon taken in the wind. like a gust of wind taking a balloon, but balloons float. so a floating movement if that makes sense. the ufo then disappeared right before going behind a cloud. this confused me at first because i swear i saw it fade very fast right before going behind the cloud. then i questioned myself, \"maybe it disappeared behind the cloud?\". soon enough i realized it had not. it was a very misty cloud, translucent. if the dark object had moved behind it i would have definitely seen the silhouette. i also would have seen the object come out of the other side of the cloud. the cloud was probably only the height of two of the ufos at most, and it would not have taken long at all for the object to reappear out the top of the cloud (after entering the bottom). after viewing a boeing type plane near the same distance away before the sighting, i have to say the ufo was at least the size of two boeing planes, maybe 2 1/2 or 3 even. it was large enough that i was able to tell the color, size and fact that it was not of this world in just the short time i witnessed the event.I tried to find a pic of the perfect tri-bead to show how it was black, yet reflective and also at the same angle the ufo was in the sky. i also added a drawing, not so good, but i tried.", "duration":

2017 i was on my way to my friends house in a taxi cab about 7:30-8 at night. while driving i look up to see a ball of light bobbling around above me right below the clouds. this lasted about 3 seconds before it disappeared, well it went out like an old lantern would when you would snuff the flame. i told the driver, you're going to think i'm nuts but i just saw something super weird in the sky. two nights later on september 11th 2017, i'm in my house and it's about 8 pm when someone started loudly banging on my door. this scared me as i am a female, was home alone and was not expecting anyone. i went into a back bedroom while i listened to whoever it was or whatever they were doing. as i'm sitting in the room i see out my window to the north 3-4 lights bright round lights sort of falling downwards. as i'm seeing this they started to move into a horizontal line while some were disappearing and then would reappear. i ran to my deck which is directly out side of the same window with my phone to video and get pictures and at this time i notice a plane flying over them as well. i had no idea as to what worldly these could be because of their actions, how they flew, how they looked. i did not feel afraid during this but more excited and wowed by them.  they would dance around each other almost like doing figure eights and then line into a perpendicular line. still while some would disappear and come back in a different area then they last were. also some would go into each other and become one. so they would fly up and down side to side but all while slowly \"falling\" downward, till they reached to about the tree line and then one by one they disappeared for good. they were in the sky for about 5 minutes totall. while i'm watching all this and taking pictures, i notice a bright green stationary light out to the north west which seemed as if it was watching all this. i took a picture of this as well but i was more focused on the several lights straight out to the north. now once they had gone this green light seemed to zip to the left, stop then zoom right over my head till gone too. almost seconds after this sighting a large all black helicopter flew into the same area flying in circles almost and went directly over my head till they finally left too. the helicopter was only there for about 30 seconds. a couple things i want to mention; i got some good pictures but spent a lot of the time capturing video, when i went back to watch the videos they were all just a white screen that would say unable to play video when i'd try to play it. it is a possibility that it was because i was close to being out of storage space on my phone. also during the sighting, while on my deck i jumped afraid because i swore i heard someone step behind me and i saw a shadow move as if there was a person coming up behind me. when i looked there wasn't anything there. maybe it was nothing or just my nerves i'm not sure. after that though i felt very unnerved by it.", "duration": "00:05:00"},{"imange_name": "444.png", "reported_at": "2017-09-21", "image_tags": "airship, dirigible", "shape": "Circle", "sighted_at": "2017-09-21",

north of us. he was working his car replacing his breaks. we were chatting for a while. he finished putting his breaks on the car and was lowering the jack, when the vehicle hit the ground i leaned over the hood of the vehicle and was kind of trying to wrap up our conversation when there was this weird moment where we both watched a regular airplane fly over. the airplane made a noise which got my attention.\n\nthat is when i saw the object. \n\ni said to the neighbor, you see that in the sky and i pointed. he was like yes. i then made a joke like is that planet x as i did not think he knew what i was talking about. at this point the object seemed like a circle like but a little no so perfect circle. it was really shinny and seemed to be reflecting the sun as the sun was setting.\n\ni was like what is that. he said it might be a weather balloon.\n\ni didnt think so, and remembered exactly where my camera was as i just got back from a trip. i ran back to the house and got the camera. when i got back outside i couldnt see it so i just started to take pictures of where i thought i saw it.\n\ntried to take pictures of in relation to the ground. the object was north but as for as the degrees i am not sure. if one was really interested they can look at the pictures and get an exact i guess.\n\nby the time i got the camera the object was not as bright and not as big. i could hardly see it and then i picked it up. i had a hard time zooming in on the object but got a few good pictures. \n\nthe event only lasted a few minutes, i would say something like 3-10 minutes not sure.  i do know that after we could no longer see it i asked the neighbor what time it was. he pulled up his phone and it was 7.33pm. if i were to guess we noticed it ~7.25pm\n\nwe kept talking. i know he is a little religious so i did not press on him to much. a few minutes later two helicopters came in from the south. i was telling him that i have heard stories about helicopters after ufo sightings but thought those were military and it was clear that first helicopter that came up form the south was small and not really a military helicopter that would hold any type of weight. the neighbor said they are looking for someone. of which it seemed like they were but it looked like they were looking for something on the ground not the air. \n\nthe helicopter passed us and was heading somewhat north where we saw the object and then turned west towards the gulf of mexico where a second helicopter met up. the second helicopter had a light on it and by this time it was starting to get dark both of the helicopters then started to travel north in a strange none linear path. we live near the pinellas trail and i do not think the helicopters were searching or flying that trail as it is kind of straight. i would say that the helicopters were in between the trail and coast moving north in a non linear path.\n\ni personally could not tell if the helicopters were related to the object in the sky. it did not seem like it but it did seem like they were looking for something. the timing was strange.  the airplane that we saw earlier was a typical airplane like a 747 commercial plane that held tourists which is common in our skys here.\n\nwhen everything die down, i checked the camera. the pictures that i zoomed in of which i attached convinced me that what i saw was either a weather balloon or something else. i am more leaning towards the something else.\n\nlater i started to zoom in on the pictures i took where i originally did not see the object and eventually found them.   \n\ni have attached all of the pictures that i have taken in this event. i saved the originals of which are the numbered pictures.Jpg and also made copies of the original where i marked with photoshop an arrow of where you can zoom in and see the object if one wants.\n\ni personally do not think this object is from our planet but can not rule out the fact that it could look like a weather balloon under some conditions type of conditions but i do not think so.\n\ni know i saw something but what it is i do not. \nit was way to early to be a star in the sky in my opinion and the object only got darker and ended up going behind clouds i think.  i know in the beginning it was very bright and shinny.I wish i had a picture of it the first time i saw it. \n\ni have filed a report with this website before on a object i saw but the investigator told me that it was most likely sirius as it was in that direction at the time i saw it back then.  i had video of that even back then.\n\nwhat i saw today i do not know but it was not sirius and i took pictures to prove it.\ni do not know if it is man made or not but i saw something and i am not afraid to say that. \n\ni am college educated. i was not drunk or am i seeking any fame. just a guy that saw something. i know there has been other much more exciting experiences and close encounters that are a better story then mine but today i saw something in the sky north of me and i was not the only one. \n\nlastly on the pictures i uploaded that have the file name [###marked with arrow.Jpg] were done in a very old version of photoshop. i did this on copies of the original file of which i am also uploading. the original files are not altered and no i did not photoshop this object into pictures, i have better things to do with my life then that these days, hell it has already taken me an hour to write this report and upload everything.\n\nplease review the pictures and you decide what it is for yourself.\n\nregards,\nchris termeer\n\nps... i also have a few more pictures if you want just email me where i can send them. the system only lets me upload 10 pictures. i have 14 pictures in total",

changing shapes and colors and it was rapidly moving erratically in a limited area of the sky.  the movements were in all directions and seemed random.  the object appeared to change shapes constantly.  it also changed colors - white, red, blue, green.  \n\ni laid down the binoculars and filmed the object on my cell phone.  i have three videos totaling about 50 minutes of the object

september 1, 2017, on our farm, we had what we believe were altostratus clouds overhead around noon, but it was mostly clear, hot sunny day...  they typically range in altitude between 6000 and 20000 feet (thats nearly 4 miles up). the wife and i were doing our normal yard work.  i was driving my small tractor across an open space, and happened to look up, saw this white dot in the sky which was not something i normally see.  \n\nthis object was in and out of the clouds. it was like a traditional shaped parachute with nothing hanging from it...  we watched it for a few minutes then i went and got the camera, our binoculars, and later my small telescope.  it was not any aircraft that i am familiar with, (i am a plane buff of sorts) nor was it a hot air balloon which we thought of also, it was not descending or ascending at all, drifting slowly eastward, no visible payload of any kind, and these three struts that went from a central hub to three points on the edges of the circle.  with the telescope you could see that these were horizontal, not hanging down beneath the dome.  we watched this \"float\" over our farm property for almost 30 minutes, after which it disappeared above the clouds, drifting eastward.  \n\ni have noted that someone in a community in quebec also saw something very similar on the same day and have reported it here on mufon, just later in the afternoon or early evening, i am convinced they are describing the same object. they said they saw the struts like a peace sign, i would say  you could trace an equilateral triangle over the ends of the lines, so not quite like a peace sign.  i have pictures and shaky video, which i am sharing.\n\nwe are about 250km west from those folks in quebec, on the north side of algonquin park, in a nearly parallel latitude.  we also observed normal commercial aircraft in the same general airspace several times during the experience.  they did not appear to react to the object, no change of course, etc.\n\nwe figured this is some sort of high altitude weather device, have reached out to environment canada and are awaiting a response.  we were a little excited about the experience, especially today, noting that someone else saw it too.  we are semi-skeptical about ufos, but not ruling it out.", "duration": "00:30:00"},{"imange_name": "457.png", "reported_at": "2017-09-18", "image_tags": "web site,

and noticed a dark object floating at my 11:00 position. i sat at the stop sign a minute, kind of dazed and wondering what the heck was i looking at. the object was dark and i could only make out the outline of it's shape when i saw the red lights on either side (left and right) blink. it looked like a football field size and was really low to the ground. i also noticed a white light blinking on the top and bottom of what i was seeing. i was thinking that whatever it was would surely crash so i turned onto the route and continued to watch it. i turned off the radio in the car and rolled down the windows, i couldn't hear any engines. nothing. i was on a \"country\" road so there were not other cars at the time to interfere sound or sight wise. i pulled over and watched it slowly float towards the south-west and i still could not hear any noise coming from it. i had to get home so i started to drive again but i kept looking over at it (it was to my left side). i was totally mesmerized. i could not figure out what i was looking at. i thought maybe a glider? but at night and so incredibly large?? i thought it was bigger than a small plane (like a 6 passenger craft) but i thought it was smaller than the size of a 747. i was completely captivated by this object and i continued to look over at the craft as i was driving. i was so \"drawn\" to look at it. i cannot explain how strange i felt looking at it but i didn't want to look away. i did not even think to try and record a video or take a picture with my cell phone but i am not sure anything would show up except the blinking red lights or white lights. i thought this might be a military aircraft of some sort? i got home and immediately told my teenage boys and they said \"cool, probably a plane\". no i don't think a plane would be silent when that low to the ground. i saw my mom the next day and told her that i have no idea what it might be and she suggested a blimp possibly. i think that might be what it was but it was just so much larger than any blimp i have ever seen. i tried google for images of blimps but none look like what i observed. anyway, i have seen satellite's glide across their arc above my backyard, i love to stargaze; i get a text message anytime the international space station is going to be visible to my area so i can go wave hello; i love meteor showers and i am fascinated by space. i truly believe that we are not alone in the vast expanse that is out there...I cannot say if i saw an alien craft. i definitely saw something awesome that i cannot identify. i really thought long and hard about should i reach out to report this...I guess i don't really want anyone to get back to me with \"oh that is a new weather balloon\". i guess i like the idea that i witnessed something amazing and unexplained. thank you for your time.", "duration": "00:15:00"},{"imange_name": "464.png", "reported_at": "2017-09-15", "image_tags": "alp", "shape": "N, A", "sighted_at":

a fixed position is still wobbled slightly back and forth trying to do so , i tried taking several photographs of the object with my cell phone and one photograph when i go to enlarge it on my cell

and because it was far away . i just thought it was a star or maybe a satellite, reflecting in the night sky and then about a week and a half later i spotted the same object, but this time it kept changing colors, radically back and forth. so at that time i had no idea what to make of it ? and ever since then when i get up at night to use the bathroom. i keep looking out the window to see if i can spot the same object again , and about three weeks later it was there again, but it was still too far away to see exactly what was and then on september 7, 2017, which was early this morning. the object was in the sky. once again but this time it was real low and was very close, so i got my shoes on and when outside to take some photographs of it, and to watch it and then at 5:03 am when i just started breaking dawn is started moving away at a slow acceleration and then all of a sudden it just took off and there is nothing that i know of that could accelerate like with this object did ,

trees were obstructing the view while in the turn. after about 30 seconds of anticipation, i saw what looked like a very long funnel, pretty much uniform from top of the sky and stopping at a thunderhead. i slid down in my seat to try to capture the length in my lens. the 2nd pic seemed to have too much sun so for the 3rd i excluded it. the strange display quickly went out of my eyeline behind me to the left. today i showed the pics to a friend and saw many things upon magnification. i don't want to be leading but i see a possible heli to the left, orbs, at leart 1 craft, a flattened square type portal, the funnel is twisting + ... but i'm using a cell and atablet to view these. i took the pics be use i had never seen anything close to this. it can't be contrails to me because the funnel is 90\u00b0 and pentrating..Endless at the top, stopping abruptly at the thunderhead. where the funnel reaches the thunderhead, i see an angled flattened square, illuminated. also the exterior of the funnel is... strange and twisted with objects..?\nplease tell me what u see. no filters on my pics. negative exposure proved to be interesting. i feel a lil crazy but after all the inspection

bright soild object with white and grey color and shape to it and with a slight halo around it. but i now think, for the brief moments i watched stunned, i was possible looking at a 'disc' and what i thought was the halo was infact the edge of the disc. \n\ni started to record with my camera phone, think i would catch it and i really thought i did but the clouds were fast moving and it was swollowed up or it moved. but, i kept filming in the hope it would come back and later when i was reviewing the footage, bingo! i got the object shooting up and away. and a analysis of the object in photoshop shows clearly a classic disc! \n\nwhat was so striking to me upon reflection and its something that will stay with me forever, was the clarity of the object completely and uttley frozen in

eclipse. my oldest son and i decided it was a cool night with a light breeze. no bugs. stars were phenomenal. we set up chairs facing west northwest. beautiful unobstructed view of the stars. a hint of the milky way. no clouds. fire dying out to glowing coals. sitting and talking about the perseids we saw two weeks ago up in wisconsin hoping we could catch a few shooting stars. we catch a few faint ones and then set up our iphones on the nightcap app. within the app there is a shooting star setting. it takes a five second open aperture shot on loop. it keeps clicking off shots until you stop it or it hits 290 shots. then it computes how many to save that had light events or movements. you have to position your phone against a stable object to keep any stars from blurring. it takes ok shots of meteors  but they stand out against the points of light that are planets and stars . so my son and i are talking. we start to see a few faint meteors followed by a few real fire balls. a good show seeing 1 or 2 about every 20 minutes or so. then we see the strangest thing. a meteor shoot up from the horizon. never seen that before. but figuring the earth is round, sure. about three minutes later ( the whole time the iphone clicking away) we see a almost horizontal fireball shoot across the sky. but instead of a straight trajectory it shoots in a strange curved almost \"u\" shape. but instead of the common burn out on most meteors it just blinks out. we give each other a high five excited we both saw it. it was very bright. high altitude. faster then anything i have ever seen in the night sky. but unusual in its trajectory. we talk about it. stay out till 1 am and collect our phones and go to bed. as i'm laying in bed i see i caught a series from one fireball. i note the first three captures at 12:01. progressive fireball. \n\nagain. there was no other light source near us to reflect anything. this was all high altitude. and we never noticed the object. however we were getting up and moving around and there were moments we were not staring at the sky. \n\ni tried zooming on the object. unable to identify. and although it was pitch black except for the stars i can't explain it. if you notice. the stars in the background are crisp. if it were an image of a blurred star all of the stars would be blurred. \nthe biggest hangup was the speed at which the previous \" meteor\" was traveling and it's obvious altitude. and how it traveled in almost a cursive u course. how bright it was and the way it's \" tail\" hung in the sky as if it were almost drawn

bright.  but never the less i still recorded it for about 3 min until it was over.  there was one cloud not very large but it made it's way in front of the sun.  we were afraid it would affect viewing.  i was watching through my phone.  i did not notice anything at the time of filming just taking in the experience but a few day's later when i reviewed the footage i watched it a few times did not really notice anything i paused it to go se what my dog was barking at and when i came back to finish up i noticed an odd square shadow protruding 3 dimensionally through the cloud so i watched it over a few times and what i saw was and dark shadow that seemed to rotate about 25 degree's to one side protrude for a few seconds through the cloud and the leading edge appeared to stick out from behind the cloud.  it was not normal in the motion so i took screen shots and zoomed in on it as well.  i have seen a ufo about 10yrs ago and reported it and remembered at work today that you all had this form that we could submit.  good thing is this time i have photo's and video.  it could be shadows made by the eclipse but i have never seen shadows form into perfect cubes before.  i wish i would have recorded more. there was also a phenomena of weird streaks going across the ground about once every few seconds.  you can hear us talking about it on the video.  we all had this weird feeling that i chalked up to something primordial from our natural reaction to seeing this.  everything was so calm no wind no noise it was an amazing experience.  i really hope you find this interesting.  and i hope i have something here. in the video if you will focus on the grey triangle shadow just below the sun in the cloud and watch it seems to turn on it's side and to the right of

bed, listening to music and trying to go to sleep. i don't know what made me notice it- one moment i was just lying there, the next my gaze was glued to the object. it was rather far away from me, and high in the sky- but big. around two or three times the size of what venus looks like in the night sky. it moved in a steady and somewhat fast line, going down towards the horizon. it looked just like a normal star, but huge and moving. the oddest part, though, was the emotional response it elicited from me. i tend to be a very emotionally reserved person- i hardly ever cry or express any other extremes. however, at the sight of this white light in the sky i felt both awe and panic. i even teared up- i have no idea why. my mind was frozen for a moment in panic as it moved down to the horizon, but once it was nearly gone i started racing through thoughts, trying to figure out what it was.\ni know it wasn't just a trick of light on the window- there were no lights on in my room, and at one point a large tree blocked the view of it. i considered airplane and missile as well, though there was no impact and the light wasn't blinking- i mention impact because it looked like it would hit the earth eventually with its trajectory, though i have no way to confirm this. it couldn't have been a meteor, either- it had no tail, and was much too big and slow to be a shooting star, not to mention there's too much light pollution in my area to even see a shooting star. it wasn't exceptionally fast or slow- though it was faster than it was slower. i don't believe it was a satellite either, as it wasn't a sudden flash but a steady, consistent light.\nafter getting over the initial shock, a new feeling dawned on me- i was scared. i had this feeling that i wasn't supposed to see that. i texted my friends about it, and something i repeated over and over in my attempt to articulate how it made me feel was, \"it was wrong. it was very very wrong. i wasn't supposed to see that. whatever that was, it was wrong.\" i stared at the spot i'd seen it go in hopes of it reappearing, but it never did as far as i know.\nthe photo attached is from earlier in the year, but of the same

exist.  i began to study spiritual energy and ectoplasm; the unseen as described in the quran  and everything concerning the possibility of extra terrestrial life.  i started collecting crystals and meditating to high frequency vibes. \n\ni also began to take photos at dusk - wherever i happened to be.  on the 21st  of march, in 2016, i took the usual photos of the area around and above my home.  as a habit, i resisted using a flash for fear of distorting whatever might be projecting natural light.  that night, took photos of what i believed (at the time) to merely be the dark night sky above and behind my home - where i had photograiphed other phenomena  (but not observed with my naked human eye), including tall dark smoky looking images, weird images reflected in a car mirror, and objects floating to the ground like a spider on a web into my ancient trees.  it wasn't until a month or so later that i noticed the two attached  photographs, as i was casually flipping through my

was about the size, color, and shape of an oncoming headlight.  however the area that were were driving in was very flat and this object was very much in the sky.\nit just looked like a ball of light. it did not look like a plane at all.\n\nat first it was stationary. we didn't think much about it. then, coming into view at our left a plane came into view. it was obvious that this was not a commercial plane. it looked like a small military type plane. it was dark-colored. the ball of light then started to match the pace of the plane.It seemed like the plane was chasing the ball of light. both moved in a stationary line. from our left to our right, then out of view over some trees. as the plane and object moved to the right, it was at an angle where it was coming closer to us and lower in the sky. that is where i got a good look at the plane. i could tell that it was smaller and darker than a commercial plane.\n\nthe photos are of course terrible. they were taken using an iphone 7 by my friend in the passenger seat as we were driving down the highway.\n\nthe light at the top left is the plane, the one at the bottom right is the ball of light. what is strange is that in the photo, the ball of light, kind of looks like what we saw, it was just a bright ball of light. the plane very much looked like a plane in real life, but when photographed, just looks like a ball of

were at a park in shelley, idaho to watch totality of the eclipse.  right before totality, i was attempting to capture the phenomenon of bailey's beads or the diamond ring effect on the moon so i was taking a series of multiple pictures.  i didn't see anything at that time.  when i looked back at my pictures, i noticed an object which was gold or brown.  if you think of the sun as a clock, the object first appeared around 11 o'clock, then the next picture it was about 9 o'clock, then 8 o'clock, then 7 o'clock.  after this, the eclipse had reached totality and the sky was too dark to see this object through the lens. obviously, i had focused my lens on the sun, so this object is blurry. i and my family were caught up in the excitement of viewing the eclipse, so none of us actually saw this object. when i showed the pictures to the other family members who were present, no one remembered seeing it - even though we were able to take off our protective glasses at the point the pictures were taken and i had taken off the solar filter on my camera.  i have some possible explanations - there were some small airplanes who were taking tourists up to see the eclipse in the sky in a neighboring city (rexburg), but again, no one witnessed nor heard an airplane in the area.  it could have been a drone, but we didn't see any drones in this park - it was relatively isolated by the snake river and there were some local people, but no one in our family party noticed a drone.  of course, it could be a bird, but it almost looks like the light is reflecting off of it. in the last picture i submitted, there is a light white object in the lower left which my space-obsessed son had already identified as the planet venus - and a viewer can see that the object in the previous 4

capture the behavior of animals on our farm during an eclipse for my blog i do on farmlife.  about 15 minutes before the full eclipse i was taking pictures of my goats.  i have a special setting on my camera that does artsy shots.  so, i press the camera once and it takes four pictures in rapid succession in different stylistic forms.  when i downloaded my pics today i noticed in one of my shots that had four different interpretations of the shot spanning about 1/100ths of a second intervals - an object in the sky high and smaller.  there were no birds flying at this time...As we had all noticed much earlier.  the animals including our chickens and turkeys had all gone to lay down.  then on the next picture the object had moved a vast amount and was larger but looks to have dropped about 300 feet directly downward.  it was shaped like a disc.  so, the odd thing is in the series of four camera shots, the first picture didnt have any object, then picture two and three both showed this disc like object and the fourth picture didnt have it at all.  so when you look at these two pictures side by side that were taken 1/100th of a second apart, it had moved a huge amount.  in the first pic that has the sphere it is tilted at an angle like it is going downward.  in the second picture it has decended  what is probably 100s of feet in the sky and the disc is now horizontal. in the pictures i sumbit below please note that they are stylized differently i.E. you can see clouds in one and not the other as that was the artsy thing the camera does...It makes the picture color or black and white.  but i wanted to point out that file 1 was the first shot of the two where the disc was higher in the sky.  file 2 the disc had dropped near vertical to much lower in the sky.  for your reference, i also noticed in other pictures wierd orb like object in the upper left to the sun the whole day......It turned pink and could even be picked up through when i took pictures through my solar glasses covering the camera lens.  i dont know what that was either.  those are files 3,4, and 6.  you actually see the mass type energy ball that i am referring to in the upper corner of the picture of image 4952 somewhat higher that the black disc.  i have no idea what this stuff is as none of us saw any of this with the naked eye.  and the one picture through the solar glasses that was put in front of the camera...You see that energy ball in it too.  so there are really two things baffling us, the black flying object and then that mega energy ball sphere that was above the black object and is seen in all pictures to the left of the sun/eclipse.", "duration": "00:00:05"},{"imange_name": "560.png", "reported_at": "2017-08-22", "image_tags": "geyser", "shape": "Diamond",

i witnesses an orb of light, with the appearance of a huge flaming object rising over lake michigan. at first site i figured it was a standard airplane lining up to land at o'hare. i came back 2 minutes later to see the object in the same spot, but slightly smaller, as it seemed to move se away from my vantage point. then i noticed a normal plane flying in the distance (not approaching chicago, but provided comparison between the two objects). the confirmed airplane sighting had sequenced flashing red lights, with a dull, white base-light. the unidentified object (ufo) i speak of had a much brighter glow - to the point of saturation when looked at through binoculars and no flashing lights at all. \n\nthe ufo had a strong fire color as it's base making up the body of the object. this was a huge light. it looked like it had a crown with three triangle tips, it was s bright - but i cant be sure if this was again light saturation. the edges of the objects would change from bright green, yellow and red depending on what angle i viewed the object through my binoculars. however, these were not flashing or sequenced in any way. it was really just how i looked at the object through my binoculars. looking straight on, the object was a singular gold flame with the shape resembling an oval blob. the shape did not have any specific edges or directional vectors to create any unique shapes.\n\nthe object remained in view for over 30 minutes ~a full hour, when it went behind a building and i could no longer see it. the object gave the appearance of moving south east (east heavy) across the lake (away from the chicago shore line)\n\nit could have been one of those lanterns people light on fire and let off into the sky. but - i don't believe it was, as it was much bigger than any normal lantern i have ever seen. also the flame remained incredibly vibrant for over 30 minutes and as it ascended se across the lake into the sky. \n\ni was able to snap some scrappy images of the light through my binoculars on the tripod - however, this low light made for a super blurry pic. but, this might help identify some other features. please note: image 1/3 is the best to demonstrate shape & the colors i was seeing. images 2/3 - 3/3 were streaked due to movement from my hand in this low light shot.", "duration": "01:00:00"},{"imange_name": "589.png",

home late and got out of my car and walked out of my garage. high up in the west (which was sraight ahead of me) i noticed a star sized orb colorfully pulsating. it was descending fast enough where i knew i needed to grab my good camera quickly in order to get a chance to get some good shots. however, it wasn't fast enough at all to be any sort of meteor, airplane, helicopter, etc. i know of nothing of that size, pulsating very bright color, that would be that high up, but slowly come down in a straight line long enough for me to observe it over about five minutes as it lowered about 5-6 inches if i measured with a ruler right in front of me. once i got my camera, i zoomed into this orb pulsating every color of the rainbow very fast. it was so bright that i couldn't see the shape of the object. it finally disappeared behind the house across the street from mine, then i couldn't do anything. unfortunately, the video i got was horrible. yet, i did capture an awesome picture. i moved a bit when taking it, so there was a trail created of the object. yet, that trail allows anyone who sees it to observe the variety of color this object illuminated and just how bright it really was. this picture is a picture my phone took of the display screen of my camera and it still looks cool. i live right by a major airport, within a couple miles. i have airplanes roaring over my home constanly. this wasn't a plane, plus it was a couple miles away, straight ahead (west), high up in the sky. you could argue it was coming in for a landing from miles away. but then it would not be descending straight down without coming closer to the airport which was a couple miles from me to my left (south). if it did land, it would have landed miles away from the airport with that behavior. also, last time i checked too, planes blink at night using two or three colors. they do not pulsate very rapidly (non-stop) between the colors of the rainbow.", "duration": "00:07:00", "imange_name":

sandusky in our truck. i saw  a vertical contrail and remarked that it was unusual. i thought perhaps it was a stunt plane but there were no planes in the sky. \n\nthe sky was beautiful with huge clouds. something just didn't seem right. i took out my camera and began to take a series of pictures. the first picture #107, shows, the vertical contrail. my husband said  he thought it was an optical illusion but it definitely was vertical, not a normal horizontal contrail. \n\nthe second picture i took, #108,  you will have to enlarge the pictures to see the orbs/lights, you can scan the picture and you will see at the very top, a few objects. the third picture #109, again shows small orbs. #110, is one of the pictures that you can see the orbs going across the highway. my suggestion is to use your magnifier on your computer to look at these objects as they are scattered across the clouds. #111 is now clear, nothing to see however in #112, if you look to the right of your screen, the picture shows a multi-colored object in the sky where i had originally seen the vertical contrail.\n\nas i took the pictures,  i couldn't see anything but the clouds. once i uploaded them to the computer is when i saw the objects. they were headed north, towards lake erie. we had left sandusky and were approximately near a city called vermillion when i began to take the photos.\n\ni have found that people that can stand right next to me, can't see the objects, but i can. it has happened numerous times.  for anyone searching the sky for the ufos, i would say look when you see a rainbow

seconds of observing the whitish blue glowing dot, it took an abrupt 90 degree drop, as though it was a rock falling off a ledge and it was no longer visible which is odd because the horizon was black

the moon had a little planet next to it!  at this point, i thought my lens might have something on it, so i went back inside and cleaned both phone lenses with an alcohol wipe.  i went outside again to the front yard, raised the phone, looked through the lens and saw the same \"light spot\" once more.  now i'm thinking the street light is somehow interfering with my photos, but i don't see how,

bedroom. no leaves on trees. my residence is across the street from the fox river. my balcony faces the street and the river. enjoying the unusually warm weather, i stood in my underwear on my balcony just before going to bed. i looked southwest down the river toward the downtown area of algonquin. i observed the normal lights with a normal halo of ambient light from the streets, businesses, etc. i noticed some lights higher than the buildings which caught my interest. they were white and numerous. couldn't make out a form or pattern. the downtown area of algonquin is approximately 1 mile south of my residence on n river rd. i stood on my balcony, enjoying the slight warm breezes at that time of night. i noticed after a few minutes that the lights were moving very slowly heading north above the river. i strained my eyes to observe the lights because i was looking thru the tree limbs that made the lights flicker on and off. i thought this is rather odd and kept looking at the lights. after about 15 minutes the lights came closer and were higher than my row of 50 foot high catalpa trees along the road. i could now observe a large black form moving very slowly (1 or 2 miles/hr.)with rows of lights. all lights were white except for a red light at the front on left end on a row of maybe 10 lights. this front row of lights was 90 degrees from the heading of the object. joining this row of front lights was a row of white lights running back along the length of the form to an end row of white lights 90 degrees from the objects path, just the same as the front row of lights. the only difference between the number of lights, white colored lights, was a green light at the left end on the rear row of lights. i believe i could hear a very slight hum, but it was almost undetectable. at that time i realized that i was probably observing a ufo. the object continued in a ne direction and disappeared over the wooded hills east of the river. the height of the hills (the river valley) are about 100 feet. the craft/object just past over the height of the hills. i would guess the object was about 150 to 200 feet above the river. it was big, probably 400 to 500 feet long and 50 to 75 feet wide. the only thing i thought it could be was a blimp, but it would be very dangerous to fly a blimp that low and at that time of night. i drew a diagram of the light pattern the next morning and showed it to friends at a downtown algonquin billiard hall the next night. i do not know the exact number of lights in the pattern nor do i know the size of the lights because i had no reference point to estimate any size comparison. the path of this black form came from the horizon se of the downtown area of algonquin, over the downtown area and ne along the fox river and over the hills about 1.25 miles north of the downtown area of algonquin. i now wish i tried to shine a flashlight at it to see more of it. don't know if that would have helped since it was at least 500 feet from me. i didn't try to take a photo because i didn't know what i was seeing until it went over the trees and at that point i lost vision of it in about 30 to 45 seconds. i knew i was seeing something very strange and i recall trying to memorize the light patterns. i have lived at this location for 25 years and this was the only time i saw this object. however, i just observed some strange lights recently and i will make a separate report. i am used to the light s from commercial jets coming from the west to land at o'hare airport 25 miles east of me. this object was not

brighter, so when i looked directly at it, it had a bit of a horseshoe look to it.  but when i looked slightly away from it, i could tell the halo seemed to surround the inner light.  at this point i was very excited, and wished someone was viewing it with me, as i knew this was unlike anything i'd seen before.  i tried taking some pictures since i had my phone with me running the  iss detector app, but not much showed up. i watched it proceed northward, and the inner light varied in intensity.  i thought at first it might be splitting up but it seemed to stay as a single light with the fuzzy halo.  eventually the light was obscured by high cloud to the north, but the glow produced in the cloud was bright enough to light an area as large as a full moon, (though not as bright of course). the glow lasted perhaps a full minute.  i managed to take two more pictures when the light was at it brightest, and the object did show up on the pictures,  though unfortunately there is little detail in the pictures.  but the pictures at least are indicative of the brightness of the object.  there was never any noise from the object.\n\ni have been sky watching for decades, having viewed countless satellites, meteors and planes, but have never seen an object like this.  i believe this is the same object that was viewed by several other witnesses who have logged sightings on this site.  they were in manitoba, so we were separated by at least 1000 km, which would rule out a low flying object like a jet.  the object must have been at satellite height at least.  i hope more people will come forward. i wonder if it might have been a satellite that was starting to fall out of orbit and burn up. i'm not sure how to find that information out.  of course, it would be way cooler to find out it was an alien spacecraft, but at this point such a conclusion is pure speculation.", "duration": "00:03:00", "imange_name": "655.png", "location": "Saugeen Shores,Ontario",

room.  the balcony door was closed.  i begin to hear a faint roaring sound.  the sound got louder and louder to the point that my cat was alarmed and looking for the source. i went out on my deck at about 1:50 to investigate.  after looking at the highway expecting a truck making the racket, i look up at the sky.  to my amazement, i see a extremely low plane.  i thought that must be the source.  the roar was easily 3x higher than an normal passenger plane, which i have never heard while the tv was on in the 10 months i lived here.  the plane did not look like a passenger plane either.  the wings were shaped much different than passenger planes.  my area gets air traffic from multiple airports, big and small. as it got closer i realized that this is a fighter jet!  i was immediately taken back because this thing was going to be flying almost completely overhead.  getting closer i noticed i could actually see a pair of missiles shillouetted in the center of the wings (see fig).  i could not believe how low this jet was and i felt that it couldn't have been save or legal. this jet flew at about a 45 degree angle by the time it pasted my apartment building. once it passed over head the plane banked hard to the left and began circling eventually ending up going right again but with a greater altitude 55 - 60 degrees.  after reviewing photos of the fighter jets that we use i would say this jet was most similar to f-16 or f/a-18 hornet.\n\nat this point i notice another object in the sky.  this one immediately looks different.  it truly looked like the flying disk but tilted in an diagonal position.  the downward end was kind of pointed away and to the right of me (see fig).  i wasn't sure what this craft was.  could have it been a jet too but with reflections and certain atmospheric conditions look like it something else? or was this beyond that? regardless, this object appeared to me to be \"floating in the wind\" at first but then i saw it start to head towards the right (southwest). the jet continued to circle and climb while maneuvering towards the left side of the unknown object.  the unknown object then started moving to the left, towards the jet.  their apparent altitudes were different however so it wasn't like they were going to crash.\n\nthis is when the loud roar became really loud and i witness three more planes come from the west.  i could tell immediately that these were planes, not something unknown, and that they were most likely the same type of jet.  now i am thinking that this must be a training exercise and because of the heavy and low overcast they are doing their drills much lower, even though the first plane was uncomfortably low. but then the unknown object started to climb and circle around and descend while the planes were all maneuvering in the sky.  this seriously looked like a shot in \"top gun\".  i am still in disbelief. all these objects appeared to be dogfighting or practicing evasion techniques.  this lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  passengers planes were also within the area.  they were pretty low too as the other planes and such were dancing with each other. the unknown object then got smaller and smaller and a pretty quick pace as it fled south.  the jets did follow pursuit and the loud roaring diminished. \n\nabout 10 minutes later the roaring was back and growing in loudness.  i could hear the jet overhead but didn't see it at first.  it was up in the clouds now was flying back north and the roaring faded away. the other jets and the unknown object were nowhere to be seen. another 5- 10 minutes pass and i hear the red shift effect of the roaring jet coming back over head heading in a different direction.  this cycle repeated several more times.  i got the impression that this jet was searching for something.  could be possible that it was just running some type of drills. \n\nultimately i want to know what exactly i saw.  is there anyway for me to find out if the military just ran a training mission over my apartment at an extremely low altitude?  was the unknown object really a jet and just looked different? and why did the unknown object seem to float around before maneuvering more drastically?", "duration": "00:30:00", "imange_name": "658.png", "location": "North Plainfield,New Jersey", "shape": "Disc", "sighted_at": "2017-08-06"},{"reported_at":

am uncertain as to the year or month, but i do remember it was close to midnight because my friend, paul, and i often talked about the girls at the event we went to every week end and the dance ended at 11:00 pm...So we would park in the alley behind where he lived on sawtell blvd. (between venice blvd. and washington blvd.)...I was leaning on the front of my mother's white corvair which was pointed approximately se and from over the tops of some palm trees at the far end of the alley i noticed something very strange looming larger and larger until it cleared the palms and i could see it was a something shaped like a stingray...But the tail wasn't that long...It was glowing pink in a very strange way...The way a black light appears if you stare at it...With fuzzy edges but a very distinct shape...And it was obvious to paul that i was no longer listening to him and he said \"what's wrong?\" and i pointed to the object as it loomed larger and larger, perfectly silently, moving in a steady slow motion until it was right over us, quite high but quite big...I don't know why i could determine this except it stirred tremendous emotion in me because of this...I had never seen anything even remotely like it...And now paul too was staring up at it as it came to a halt right above us. we were staring straight up at it's underside which had two fuzzy dark ovals in the center...I think we were both so dumbfounded we said nothing...Everything was glowing pink in the alley, the tree tops, the white corvair, our clothing, everything...And i noticed a strange metalic taste in my mouth...How strange, i thought, that it paused right above us like that...Also, i knew for a fact that we were witnessing the very first real contact with extraterrestrials and that all of culver city must be witnessing the same thing...It was sooo huge...Suddenly it departed, kind of sliding off sideways and climbing, but at a speed so fast it left a series of fading images of itself...Then it disappeared altogether in a somewhat northerly direction. so then paul and i run inside his place and wake up his parents and tell them to turn on the television because this is going to be on every channel!...But nothing...His parents say \"have you two been drinking?\"...We are totally blown away that there is no mention of it on the radio or televsion...Nothing...We keep checking the news for weeks...Nothing...We talk about it together all the time for years...We think we must be mutually crazy...We write our observations and compare notes...It all matches...What should we do? we wonder...If we mention it to others they always say...Oh sure, how come no one else reported it? no one believes us. how could this be, we ask ourselves...What the hell is this? we are frightened and weirdly traumatized by the fact that there is no corroboration of any kind except ourselves...We know we experienced something so profound together. we know it has bonded us for life...That's a laugh...I don't even know if he's still alive...Here i am nearly 70 years old and reliving that night over and over...I often return to that alley and park there and just stare up at an indifferent sky...Once someone said: \"what are doing here?\"...Naturally i couldn't say...I don't really even know...It's all very peculiar...But still vivid in my mind...And when i think of it i can taste that weird metalic taste in my mouth...It's like taste memory...And i can still see

never looked like this, so i went out on my back porch to see them better.\n\nwhen i first saw them, i suspected they were ufo's since they looked like nothing i'd ever seen before.\n\nat first there were 4 of these orb like, glowing reddish orange things in the sky. they had moved from west to east and as they did so, they hovered in two rows of two, close to each other. then, as i watched, one by one more of them started coming up. as the others rose to the same height, the first ones began to fly away slowly. they moved in a curved pattern. as they headed north, they vanished. it was as if the lights just went dim. they seemed to be moving slowly, but in a matter of seconds they had gone from looking large to very tiny, and then just disappeared. there was no sound. i thought perhaps it was someone playing with friends with drones or something, but the things just didn't look like drones, airplanes or anything else familiar. they were round to teardrop shaped- almost like a fat bottomed egg. all were about the same size and all glowed the same. there seemed to be almost a handle effect over them. the \"handles\" on top were slightly lighter and more blurry than the bottoms. i couldn't discern any exterior lights as the entire things were glowing. they were deliberate in movement- not choppy or irregular. they almost gave the feeling of candles in bags floating in the air, except they were too bright, not the right shape and the way they moved was as if there was a deliberate path, curving up from a lower point, heading east, then stopping, hovering in formation, and curving northwest for a second, and then north, in single file until they went out like a match being blown out! if it had been drones, there would have been noise. no noise at all. no engine sounds. a small plane was in the sky heading north as they were going out of sight.\n\ni watched until they simply disappeared. it was very strange. i wanted to grab my camera, but knew if i did, i could miss it. the thing i thought was the most odd was that even though they seemed to be moving very slowly and gracefully, they went from being quite large and hovering in a pattern two over another two, and as they drifted away, they seemed to become very small very quickly, though they didn't appear to be going fast at all. oddest thing i ever saw!\n\ni am uploading a rough sketch of

the 15th floor of a high-rise in downtown san diego affords my family spectacular city views and on an intermittently clear early morning like last saturday this object was unequivocally visible. heading outside onto our south-facing balcony, i was able to capture some remarkable pictures and video although i was only using my iphone 6 as i don\u2019t own any proper photography equipment. \n\nof particular significance, i was able to simultaneously record both the object and a commercial airliner on its westbound arrival path into lindbergh field from 4:53am-4:59am pst. although the plane did not seem to respond to any advised deviation from air-traffic control during its normal course, it's runway approach was not very far to the south of the object and it eventually passed underneath the object's stationary elevation prior to landing. for any downtown san diego resident with regular visibility of arriving flights, it's nearly always customary to see multiple planes landing in staggered groups of two to three or more, yet after the initial red-eye arrival there were no subsequent incoming aircraft. \n\ni'd be eager to learn from faa records if any post-5:00 am pst arriving flights were diverted or delayed as a result of the object's presence considering the extremely high probability that the pilots viewed the object for many miles before and during their descent. prior to the object's astonishingly rapid ascent out of view, i took several 1-3 minute video clips and also a couple dozen pictures from 4:41am-5:31am pst that i\u2019m confident are worthy of taking the time to view and scrutinize.\n\nas for the morning of 7/30/17, this is where i got much more than i bargained for. as a casual follower of dr. steven greer's contributions to the ufo community, i recall reading once how he used coherent thought to manifest the presence of eti's and so i half-jokingly decided i'd give it a shot the next morning, not thinking with any genuine expectation whatsoever that something would come of it. throughout the entire next evening while burning the midnight oil working on corporate contracts (yes, i'm a white collar stiff unfortunately), i attempted to allocate conscious thought towards that same object appearing in the same location at the same time. to my bewilderment at 4:18am pst on 7/30/17, i began witnessing another aerial object with identical characteristics in the same location.\n\nwhat occurred and i was able to document on 7/30/17 from 4:18am-5:27am pst has candidly made me quite uncomfortable ever since but i feel compelled to share it. as i was viewing and recording the object i began experiencing a heightened physiological response, but unique to me, it was coupled with a strong dulling of my motor skills. moving past my fear, i started to sense some kind of palpable connection with the object and reciprocal communication directly with it via mental energy and nonverbal messaging. on 7/30/17 at 5:14am pst after several minutes of singular focus on my request that the object \"show me something special\", the object tilted vertically and projected an unmistakable \"face\" encompassing its halo which, thankfully for my own sanity's sake, i was to photograph. the \"face\" appears to perhaps be wearing a crown with 4 or 5 points atop a very wide face with large, round cheeks, a broad nose, dark but non-threatening eyes and of all things, a broad slit-smile. as the sun began to rise over the east county foothills, the object remained highly visible in half-lit sky and i continued taking

fireworks that shoot into the sky. they glow orange when high up,blink  blue red and white in sequences, or hover low with just a bright light. one large light in particular stays hovering in the ne e all the way until complete daylight and it seems to have a powerful almost invisible light beam shining in slow 360 degree circles. not to mention, a few nights, we watched the smaller orbs form lines and surround the large bright light. the lights usually start to come from the east behind a hill or mountain and just disintegrate after crossing the complementary direction of the earth. i don't

how the \"stars\" orange orbs surround it in different patterns and take off way up high or scatter around near the horizon line. they hovered high with a swaying motion. we watched them escalate in

sky on the west side of the street. the light was so bright, i would describe it as a spotlight glaring right into my eyes, that it caught my attention in the bright blue sky. i told my girlfriend to look in the direction of the object and to take video of it with her phone. after having difficulties with her phone i told her to use my phones camera. \n\nshe brought up my camera on my phone and proceeded to video the object. at first she could not see the object because the object would dissappear and reappear. but when it appeared she saw the object and took video of it until it would dissappear again. the object would ascend and descend appear and dissappear moving from the west to the east and back again. \n\nwe tracked the round object for some time until we made it to our destination. while filling our propane tank we told the attendant about the object and all of us were scanning the skies to see it, but we could not find the object in the sky. after filling the propane tank we jumped back in our truck and proceeded northbound on indianapolis boulevard once more to our next destination to buy party favors and balloons for the party. \n\nwhile driving northbound and scanning the skies we saw several airplanes, i then told my girlfriend to try to video some airplanes for comparison to the object we saw. \n\nafter driving a short distance and scanning the skies for the object, we once again saw the object on the east side of the street. again it was appearing and disappearing, moving from east to west, it did not have a linear pattern. she again took video of the object until it dissappeared. \n\nwe then made it to our destination and went into the store to buy our supplies.  by the time we came out of the store it was getting dark and we could not find the object in the sky. \n\nafter arriving at home i took a really good look at the videos. in the videos the object was round and bright white. after zooming in on the object i noticed that the object had a black spot in its center. while looking at the video of the airplane, the aircraft was further away but you can clearly see the fuselage, the wings, and tail of the plane.\n\nafter reviewing the videos with my girlfriend who is a flight attendant, we both are in agreement that the round bright white object we saw was clearly not an airplane. \n\nfyi. i am

imaginary friend, tony smithenhouser.  tony was very, very tall with long arms and was a conductor or engineer  on the railroad. he wore a special suit for work and a hat.  our property had a rr easement through it.  everyone in my family knew about my friend and would refer to him speaking to me whenever a train horn went off nearby.  i have always lived by train tracks!\ntony would come to visit me during the night because trains were not very busy then.  he would walk through our field and knock on my bedroom door 3 rapid knocks and a scrape.  my door opened to the outside. tony would tell me stories of far away places and promised me someday he would show me the snow...We rarely have snow in my area.\ni lost touch with tony smithenhouser somewhere around 12.  don't know why.\nhis visits always led me outside to look up at the night sky.  i could feel comfort there.\nfast forward to 1986 and i was still living in my parents home, but taking care of my mother, who had terminal breast cancer.  it was in february and my bedroom flooded as the wind pushed the rainwater over the foundation and into my bedroom.  i recall vividly when i propped open my door to the outside to air out the musky smell.  i was using a towel to soak up the rainwater across the room when i stopped and froze.  it felt like all the air was sucked out of my bedroom.  no sounds at all.  i felt a presence enter my room from outside.  i heard communication within my thoughts, though not male or female.  the sound was musical.  i turned and saw 2 beings unlike anything i'd ever imagine.  they were hovering above the floor of my room, near the open door.  their skin was pearlescent, and glowed white.  their heads were hairless and their skull only slightly larger in width than ours would be.  their communication  with me in musical tones that i somehow understood. there were only 2 beings, one taller, both wearing flowing gown of white...Very white.  the taller being looked at me directly and asked me to trust it.  the smaller being outstretched it's 4 fingered hand, long fingers, no thumbs.  my hand reached outward but did not touch the hand of the being.  inches apart, my body  elevated and we were hovering at the doorway.  was i comfortable?  yes.  we moved effortlessly,  slowly down the long side porch, me hearing their communication all the while.  we stopped.  i was hovering above the ground.  i was asked to look forward as far as i could see.\nfar from our house, in the middle of our 87 acre hay field was a ship.  it hovered above the ground.  more beings stood in hover formation as we glided toward the craft.  it was pleasant and familiar, as though i were once again with tony smithenhouser.\ni remember nothing after this except waking up in my bed, in my clothing and muddy shoes under the covers at 3:33am hearing that musical notes blaring in my ears.  i felt panic and breathless.  what happened?   i knew it happened, was real.  but what and why?   i fell asleep and missed work the next day. i don't honestly recall anything after that.\n\nthe music sounded much like kitar, but slower and echoed.\n\ni was a willing participant.  i was left with a pea sized lump under my left ear.  countless doctors, no one notices.\n\ni have a calling now to photograph the sun, moons, skies, clouds, planets.\n\nlast night i captured orbs, spheres and worm like craft.  beautiful!\n\nno trepidation felt.  i enjoy the time behind the lenses.\n\ni have a genetic mutation disease called s.A.P.H.O. syndrome.  came on suddenly in 2006.  82 specialists from stanford to ucla have no explanation or treatment...Other than for pain.  i have photos, documents, labs, gallium scan fail, etc. of the testing i had done from 2006 through 2014.  now i use

appeared to be a blood moon. i was walking east towards my house and at first glance i could notice something floatimg above the lake. it was very bright like a star and reflecting off michigan like the moon was. i had been star gazing just an hour earlier, this object was not there an hour earlier. but something was off about it, it was unnaturally bright. i wiped my eyes and at second glance i could see multiple lights and noticed it slowly ascending into the sky. i couldnt belive what i was seeing i was a bit in shock or disbelief being a person of christianity. i knew it was time to film. i pulled out my phone and took multiple pictures but thought a video would be the best bet. during the filming i remained stationary and you can distinctly see the object begin to move around and blink diffwrent colors. after reviewing the video the following day, you can see a distinct green tint from the object as i sent to you. i ran home (just 2 blocks away) and awoke my brother we both went down to the beach and watched what occured for the next 2 hours that has my reality shook and me in fear. at first glance, he was skeptical and said it just looked like a star, at this point the obkect had ascwnded very high into the sky and morning clouds were beginning to float accross the lake. i told him to look a bit closee and he did,wven at its height you could still see multiple lights and faint blinking. we stood watching it and observing it for about 10 minutes until we could see on the horizon a distinct fold flash or explosion. from the explosion 4 not as bright lights surfaced on the horizon 5 minutes later. they were a solid 5 miles or so away feom shore but i could make out they were glowing from above and under the water. the 2 on the north began to move slowly rowards eachother anf the 2 on the south did the same. once they met with eachother the glow of their light grew by 2\u00d7 and it appeared the pairs connected together anf began to migrate towards eachother. at this point clouds completely covered the aerial ufo and once they moved it was no longer visible. it had disappeared entirely.10 minutes later the pairs on the lake united and the glow and reflection from them was equal to the aerial orb i had saw. i began to travel south and i stopped watching. since seeing the ufo and sharing my video and evidence with feienda and family. my mom has claimed to see flaehing lights in pur backyard and my brother has claimed to see them too. could be possible paranoia. on july 20th me and both my mom and brother heard unnatural growling and almost gissing coming from the beach from our backyard; i live on lakeshore property. couldve been racoons or some other animal the beach and bluff is abundant with life. but just today i had a unnaturally lucid nightmare that brings me to tears in fear just reviewing it which i can do so vividly. i am reaching out to you as i am concerned for my and sheboygans safety. death is a human construct but i am fearful of the unknown. the dream beganbwith me and my girlfriend being at a nearby neighbors house outside on the porch. no ones around and its evening but very cloudclomy girlfriend laying on a matress naked on the porch. nearby on the right side of the house is a clothes line with an oversized beed sheet about 20 ft x 20 ft blowing in the wind. im standing in front of it. my girlfriend calls to me and i smile. a gust of wind begons and the sheets blow south covwring the bottom view of my girlfriend. than something behing the sheet grabs her legs and pulls her behind the sheets. she begins screaming for my help. but i am paralyzed i cannot move at all. i hear the same growling sounds heard on the beach the other day as my girlfriend screams foe me and says \"an alien is attacoinf her.\" i cant speak or move im vulnerable and the only reason im in thos world is being raped or killed by whatever the fuck is behind this unaturally large sheet. i wake up soaking in sweat, in tears screaming my girlfriends name. my brother wakes up too and we both feel a very odd atmosphere in the house. we search the house and find nothing. pleaee get back to me asap

camera mounted up on a pole on the back of the house.  seeing what needed to be done to mount a new surveillance camera i had bought to replace the old one and run new wiring.  the sky above was clear and blue.  some clouds off to the west.  \n\ni noticed off to the east, maybe slightly northeast, something shiny in the sky and began watching it as it approached.  i originally thought it was a passenger jet.  as it got a bit closer i could clearly see it had a shape very similar to a passenger jet but the wings were in the back angled forward, and what looked like smaller wings coming out at a 90 degree angle towards the front of the craft.  it sounds ridiculous but it looked very much like a passenger jet flying backwards.  the main wings seemed larger than those of a passenger jet however.  it also appeared a lot shinier then the jets i see flying over... looking like chrome illuminated by the sun.  and although it appeared slightly larger than a passenger jet flying over at altitude it also looked to be flying much higher, so it must have been much larger.  \n\ni am somewhere around 30 miles north-northeast of philadelphia international airport and have lived in this area for 42 years.  so i am very familiar with passenger jets flying overhead.  this thing i saw definitely had very large wings at the back of the craft and they were angled forward.  much like if you took a 747, made the wings at least twice as thick front to back and about 30% longer and flew it backwards.  and also much like a jet flying in reverse it seemed to have small wings on the front of the craft but those were at a right angle to the main body, not swept.  it's hard to judge but it seemed to be flying much faster than a passenger jet, and as i said much higher.  if i held a dime in my hand with my arm fully extended that would cover the length and width of the craft from my perspective but although it was a clear sky and the craft was very shiny, looking like it was reflecting the sun, and i could see it's outline fairly clearly, it seemed a oddly distorted due to what i'm assuming was the atmosphere between me and it.  it did not noticeably turn, or alter height or speed.  no sound, no trails behind it.\n\ni didn't take my eyes off it from the time i first saw it.  it approached from the east-northeast in broad daylight in a clear sky.  i watched it as it flew just about directly overhead maybe a few degrees north, still in a crystal clear sky. i continued watching until it went over the clouds to the west-southwest.  i'm guessing it was about 10 - 15 seconds from the time i noticed it until it went out of view over the clouds the the west.\n\ni had no feelings other than confusion as i realized it's shape.  i was wondering if it could be a satellite. for appearing (from my perspective) slightly larger than a jet flying above the clouds, but looking like it was much higher in the sky and going a little faster, i thought it must be absolutely huge and moving very fast.  \n\ni stopped writing and made a sketch in gimp while it was still fresh in my mind.  it's a good approximation of the size and shape of what i saw.  i wish i knew more about the image editing program so i could have portrayed the chrome shininess of it and the atmospheric distortion that made it look so high up.  i also spent a good hour on google looking at images of planes and satellites trying to find an explanation.  i know how much the the picture looks like a plane but it was absolutely flying in the wrong direction to be that.  and even though it's similar the shape didn't match any plane.  \n\ni'm 42 years old, completely lucid and fairly intelligent.  i don't do drugs and haven't touched a drop of alcohol in 12 years.  this thing i've seen has really blown my mind.  i just can't put into words how odd this was.  i had been working all afternoon on getting all my programs reinstalled on one of my computers, periodically letting myself get distracted reading about network security.  the weather cleared up from a rainy morning and i figured i would get off my butt and find a project away from the computer.  seeing something weird in the sky was the absolute furthest thing from my mind.  now this has completely derailed anything i had going on today.  i would give anything to get a second look at that thing.  i'm honestly not convinced it was aliens, but not saying it wasn't either.  it could have been some secret government aircraft (ours or otherwise) or some kind of satellite the general public doesn't know about.  i'm really so bugged i'm tempted to try to report it to the military.  maybe it was some foreign governments new stealth spy plane/satellite they could be trying to track.  oh well.  if that's the case hopefully some agency somewhere is watching these mufon reports.  sadly i will probably never know what i saw.  but i absolutely saw something completely abnormal.", "duration": "00:01:00",

saw a large, very vibrant bright object that appeared to me to be round in shape, so bright it seemed to glow, and it was quite large compared to the size of an airplane that might pass overhead to the north or northwest, even a plane in a fairly low flight pattern. it was moving quite rapidly eastward, and initially, its path was parallel to the earth (or so it seemed to me). for a moment it disappeared as it passed behind a tall maple tree that blocks a small portion of the view to the northwest of our home. when the object again became visible, it remained parallel to the earth/horizon for (i'm guessing) about ten seconds; then, it seemed either to get smaller or to increase its distance from my location; it absolutely seemed to gain altitude at this point, from about 35 degrees above the horizon to 45 degrees above the horizon.\n\nthen, the object stopped moving, and after remaining in place for seconds, it totally ceased its prior, straight path and started to move in many different ways: up, down, sometimes going backward, at other times moving forward, accelerating, decelerating, hovering, and moving in quick, turning paths as it would move up or down. to my eyes, it remained a glowing, vivid reddish orange the entire time. the light varied in intensity with no seeming relation to its movements, except that it appeared brighter when it was lower to the horizon. at one point, the object, while stopped and seeming to hover at a total standstill, appeared to split into two of itself; it looked as if the original object either ejected another object identical to itself or simply went from being one object to being two objects. the second object appeared below the first/original object, meaning slightly closer to the horizon; when it appeared, it seemed to come out of a glowing, flame-like emission the same color as the original object itself. the second object was identical in appearance to the first, but was slightly smaller. it only remained visible for a small fraction of a second before vanishing without any hint of movement.\n\nthe original object continued to be visible for a bit longer, continuing its quite varied path of movement and non-movement. shortly before it was no longer visible, the object was hovering, stationary, then suddenly seemed to grow a bit larger in appearance (perhaps it was closer, i do not know) and at incredible speed shot to the right (moving eastward) and then shot upward (seemingly in terms of altitude) in a steep diagonal path (east-to-west at a very steep angle, not moving in a perfectly straight line), before again shooting to the right (eastward). every movement was made in a beautiful, agile manner and even at the time the moves it was making reminded me of watching fighter jets and jet teams during air shows as their pilots push the boundaries of what their own crafts are capable of doing, moments that may sometimes be equally as thrilling for the pilots as they are for any observers. \n\nthe object was stationary to the north when it became invisible to me. low clouds (which i only now realized were moving from the southeast toward the northwest) first intermittently obscured the object, then at last totally obscured it. it did not become visible again and shortly after (within two minutes), lighting was flashing heavily around us and we went indoors. the object was, to me, completely silent.\n\nwhat i felt initially, immediately after i first saw the object was a very calm, content, warm feeling of safety and security throughout my body and mind. this was briefly mixed with an unpleasant feeling that -- well, you know when two magnets repel each other -- that's the only way i can describe the prickly feeling that felt as if it physically needled at the side of me where my father stood or sat; his reaction was one of nervousness and fear. that negative feeling was brief, and as soon as i stepped a few feet further away from him it ceased, and with the calming effect of whatever was going on, i calmly called to my mom through the open window (not knowing she was already on her way outside) something to the effect of, \"mom, it's a ufo thing! it's really neat!\" \n\nmy mom came outside and with her, in addition to the constant content, safe feeling, i also felt what was the complete opposite of the prior sensation of magnetic repulsion; i instead felt a sort of magnetic attraction toward her and a magnetic awareness of her location in the dark yard. she and i walked farther away from the house into our backyard where we stood side by side, both of us with our iphones held up to the sky at about a 45-degree angle to focus on this object, while my father remained behind on the patio. i could not visually see my mom in the yard -- i am nearly totally blind at night, with only minimal light-perception (this object was so bright that it obviously fell into the category of \"light i can perceive\") -- yet with this magnetic instinctive feeling i knew exactly where my mom was moving at every moment. she took photos, and while i took a few photos initially, i primarily i kept my phone focused on the object recording it on video. for me, i heard nothing from the object, nothing either physical nor internally, no buzzing, no engine noise, nothing at all. but even without hearing any sound, i \"knew\" it was moving under its own power and never doubted (and still don't) that someone (i felt that most likely there were actually 1, 2 or 3 \"someones\") was present inside of the object and in charge of the movements of the object. i felt an impression of relative inexperience yet full competence, youth in terms of mentality and not physicality, and also an impression of excitement entwined with wisdom, as if whoever was up there was both learning how to \"pilot\" the object and having a wonderful time while doing so. it felt as if whoever was there was aware of my presence, and whether it was for my/our benefit, the benefit of others, or for their own enjoyment, it felt to me as if they were showing off a little, and were rather pleased with and proud of themselves. \n\nthe experience resulted in a fairly inexplicable feeling that is most similar to emotions i once experienced, but which have since been fairly rare since childhood. it is a feeling of how the simplest of things can make you smile or make you happy, of knowing that everything is right with the world and that you are safe. watching this object, i felt very content and, for lack of a better word, whole. the strongest of that feeling lasted about 24 hours. \n\ni had the distinct and certain \"feeling\" the next evening, monday evening, that someone who was somehow related to the object with which this report deals was going to be or was already present in the sky again that evening or night (if they'd ever actually \"left\"). i went outside to take photographs, hoping to perhaps capture something unusual and also wanting to get photos of the gorgeous cloud formations which accompanied some light rain and thunderstorms nearby around sunset. i took photos for i'd say around 30-45 minutes during which the clouds were moving quickly, the light and cloud-shapes doing amazing things (just clouds being clouds), but i knew that yet also felt that someone (\"someones\") related to that object was there and was watching and aware of my presence. that feeling, along with the persistent, almost overwhelming feeling of contentment and security lasted until about 8:55 p.M. as i was photographing clouds to the west, there was an abrupt obscuring of one cloud layer by another and at that instant, too, the feeling of contentment was greatly diminished and the feeling of someone else being \"there\" was gone entirely. \n\ni still did feel this on tuesday, but perhaps at 30% of the strength as i'd experienced the night i saw this object. there is still a lingering sense of it, as well, which seems to slightly blunt the depth of my negative emotions and reactions. it is, more than anything, an unexplainable feeling of security and peace.", "duration": "00:02:00", "imange_name": "722.png", "location": "Vandalia,Ohio",

out my bedroom window before intending to close my curtains.  the view is almost due east from my apartment in west longview, washington.  i saw an amber light that i assumed was a single-engine private aircraft traveling northwards and traversing my line of sight horizontally from right to left.  i estimate that it was approximately 3-4 miles away, moving slowly at about 2500 ft., and roughly the size of a small automobile.  we see a lot of small planes flying around here like that, so it was certainly not unusual except that this aircraft didn\u2019t have the typical blinking red anti-collision beacon on.\n\njust when i motioned to close the drapes, the object suddenly moved in the opposite direction.  that caught my attention because aircraft don\u2019t reverse course so abruptly.  it continued southwards, left to right from my perspective, only for 4-5 seconds or so and then reversed course again in the same manner.  i kept watching.\n\nabout 10 seconds after the object had resumed its northerly course, it completely stopped moving and turned into a brilliant blue light.  it hung there in the sky motionless for several seconds (i\u2019m not sure exactly how long) and then dropped straight down vertically at a much greater speed, perhaps four times its previous horizontal speed.  i was startled.\n\nquickly, when the object was only a few hundred feet above the hilly forested terrain, it stopped once more and turned back into an amber light.  then, it moved vertically downwards again very, very slowly for only a few seconds and disappeared.  i assumed the amber light had turned off.\n\ni waited for a couple of minutes, but couldn\u2019t see it again.  i went into my bathroom for 6-7 minutes.  afterwards, i returned to my bedroom window

little over a year ago. they usually number between 3 and 7 and can be seen with the naked eye flashing blue, green, red, yellow. the main body of the object glows with a bright white light. through binoculars,it's easy to see the blue, green, red and yellow whirling, pulsating/rotating lights that revolve around the middle of the objects, almost as if it's a propulsion mechanism. i researched satellites and was able to rule them out--these objects remain hovering but are usually fairly stationary, as if they are cloaking themselves as stars. they are not planets or stars--they sometimes group fairly close together, and sometimes they are further apart--this is observed night after night and can be clearly seen on clear nights. i have watched them fly erratically in the night sky, zigzagging from left to right, right to left, and have watched them drop like a stone to a nearby mountainside--but that's only occasionally. when they've \"dropped\" there is no sound of a crash, and they do not make any sound. for the most part, they remain hovering and can be seen from sunset until sunrise. the strangest incident was the only one that has frightened me in 7 years i've seen them; i was painting a guest bedroom in my cabin and was moving a table out to the deck to clear out the room. my attention was caught by a terrible, frantic bleating of an elk (they are plentiful here). looking towards the sound i saw a blinding white light on the mountainside. it was whirling around, much like a police light, but this light lit up the foliage and trees around the area and its intensity and size was much greater. \ni have had neighbors, friends and family members witness these objects regularly from my deck which offers a 360-degree view of the night sky (the cabin sits on a high point and the land slopes down from there, so nothing blocks a visual of the sky). \ni'm posting again to include several pictures, that have been enlarged to view them better. i have a cannon 5x 16.0 basic digital camera that doesn't pick up the light these objects throw as seen by the naked eye.\nif ever a mufon investigator is available to visit, i would welcome the feedback about what i

its common to see mysterious glowing lights and orbs in the sky in emerald isle nc, which seems odd because there's loud jets that fly by often i'm guessing from a government base nearby so maybe

crew tearing down an old high school across the road from my building, and to check on the current temperature, when this object caught my eye, drifting at first in my direction (fully south), coming from the north area of the city, closer to the lake. it was fairly large, and i estimated it to be almost the size of an austin mini cooper car. it looked solid/3d, and was rectangular and box-like in shape. the colour was a dark grey, but parts of it appeared to be a lighter grey. it changed direction as it approached my area, turning left, and heading toward the town of stoney creek (south-east/east). my neighbourhood is on the border of stoney creek, and this object floated away over that town and out of sight. i captured a few photos of it with my mobile phone, but by the time i went into my apartment to get my phone and returned to the balcony with it, the object had moved further away, so the photos don't show it very well. i had no idea what this object was when i first noticed it, or when it sailed past my location. it looked like a large, rectangular, metallic box. how it was airborne, and how it remained so, completely puzzled and mystified me. i was talking on my house phone (cordless handset) with a friend while all of this was going on, and i remember just laughing slightly when i first saw it, telling her, \"holy crap... there's a ufo heading this way, and by that, i mean an unidentifiable flying object.\" then after it started to turn toward the east i said, \"well, now there's a large metallic, rectanglar box just sailing past this neighborhood... gonna grab my phone and take some photos.\" so i stepped inside, grabbed the phone, and took about a half-dozen photos, before it sailed too far away. i don't know how to describe my feelings at the time, really... nothing extraordinary, because i had no idea what this object could be. i was just really puzzled/curious, more than anything, because i couldn't figure out what it was. i'm still

of flying craft rise up above the trees, just to the north of i-55 in relation to my house. when i first saw it, it seemed very close. the object from my perspective at that time seemed to be about the size of a silver dollar. i could tell that there were multiple lights on the craft but when i first saw the object, all of the lights were very bright and seemed to represent one very bright light. this is the closest i was to the object (when i initially saw it).\n\nthe object went straight up at a very high rate of speed with no angle of deviation whatsoever. when the object reached a certain altitude (at this point the object looked about the size of a penny) it stopped very quickly and began to hover. i watched the object hover for around 30 - 45 seconds. at this point, i noticed 4 individual lights which seemed to be in the shape of a diamond. the top light wasn't very bright. the side lights seemed to be very bright and somewhat oval shape. the bottom light was somewhat round and also very bright. these lights were a yellow-orange color and would flicker sporadically. the object made absolutely no sound at all. i wanted to run into the house to grab my phone but i was completely amazed and i was afraid it would be gone by the time i grabbed it. after watching the object hover for 30 - 45 seconds, i ran into my house to grab my cell phone. i'm guessing that approximately 20 seconds had lapsed by the time i got back outside. at this point the object was still hovering.\n\nabout a second or two later, the object sped off very fast in a se direction. it was also traveling up as it sped away. it moved so fast the lights seemed to leave a brief tracer. i was able to snap one quick photo before it disappeared over my house. at this point, the object was probably about the size of a dime. again, there was no sound from the object at all. there were multiple planes in the sky as i live near midway airport but they were all very high in the sky.\n\nthe object seemed to move too fast to be a plane or drone. i see planes all day and night and this object did not resemble any plane i have ever seen. also, if the object was rocket propelled, i would

was no trail like would come with a firework. i watched it closely waiting to see if it was going to explode. when it did not, i knew it was something strange. it looked slightly hazy around the edges, as if the atmosphere was being disturbed around it. it hovered for about 2 minutes. long enough for me to run into the garage and grab my cell phone. i intended to video tape it, but being the dork i am, i had my iphone set to \"photo\" and not \"video\", so all while i thought i was getting amazing video, i had only taken one still photo! the orb was large at first. about the same size as the moon that night, then slowly got smaller until it was invisible.  another odd thing about it, as far as i could tell, base on the position of clouds and smoke in the air from fireworks, it didn't appear to be moving away, it just got smaller. i have never seen anything in the sky that i didn't think could be explained, i would love to know more about what i've seen. i also would like to know

hrs i saw the following from my bedroom window in veitsch, styria.\ni have my pc there and was looking again like countless times towards stanglalm (n.B. that is a local mountain south of my home).\n\ni saw 3 silent dark grey objects approx. 20-30meters in length or diameter coming from the area of sommerberg flying/gliding towards stanz in m\u00fcrztal.\nmy window was open and at first i thought i saw birds, it was absolutly quit outside, aeroplanes and helicopters make quite a sound.\n\nthe three flew in a straight line after one other, the first two a few hundered meters apart and the 3. about 10 second behind the second object at the apearently same height and direction.\n\ni knew they were objects rather than bird when the flew through some sort of electrical cloud, i could see numerous flashes of light on the \"skin\"/outer grey layer on each object.\n\na bird would die instantly if caught in a lightning bolt and crash.\n\ni saw each object approx. 3-5 seconds, that was to short to get my olympus 800uz, as it takes 30-45 seconds to fire it up..\n\ncheers and kind regards jacques aus veitsch, highstyria.", "duration": "00:00:20", "imange_name": "794.png", "location":

10 just south west of picton ontario at approximately 60km/h. passed the airport and descending down the escarpment (traveling west) when an unidentified craft was spotted above. it seemed to be traveling south-east from the north-west, slowly, and approximately 50-60 degrees above the horizon and stood out against the blue sky. the size at this point was the size of a canadian quarter (2.3cm/0.93\" diameter) held at arm's length. no sound was heard during the whole experience nor was any electrical/mechanical problems experienced. i slowed and pulled to the side of the road while maintaining visual contact with the object while i attempted to get my phone to take a photo. in my haste (as well as a jungle of aux and charging cables) i dropped the phone and when i got it the unidentified had already passed over the horizon. i thought it might have been an super ultralight aircraft flying into the airport but i have seen hundreds of aircraft land there and never seen any sort of configuration in such a way as this, nor was there any sound. frankly i don't even remember ever seeing any sort of aircraft land at the airport this early in the day. the majority (at least 95%) of the aircraft that land at this small airport are cessna 172 and piper cub aircraft and i have seen plenty of those and it was certainly not that. the only helicopter seen in the area that remotely has the same configuration as what i saw is a ch-47 chinook and those you can hear for miles. i live in trenton ontario which is home to 8th wing of the rcaf and my mother was in the air force and i have grown up learning about planes and i am certain it was not a plane or a helicopter. the only other thing i can think of it was being is possibly a balloon drone and that seems unlikely given the time and place of the sighting as well as having to be operated so close to the air field. eyes on object at this point was approximately 5 seconds as it traveled across my field of view and disappeared past the trees. there seemed to be a light, albeit a somewhat opaque or dull light emanating from the two circles below the main \"disk\" of the craft. my reaction both during and

quality pictures of these in the past.  it takes a lot of practice to get the proper exposure, aperture, and iso settings correct to produce a clear and good quality image of the night sky.  after several years of practice, i'm getting proficient.\n\nwhat i saw two nights ago, and what i inadvertently photographed was not a star, meteor, airplane, helicopter, or a comet. at around 2:15 a.M. eastern time,  i was taking 20 second exposure pics (using a tripod obviously).  while the exposure was being done, i had 20 seconds to scan the sky for anything interesting for my next shot.  well, during one exposure i caught someone out of the corner of my eye.  they were two lights that resembled brighter stars but weren't \"twinkling' like stars do.  these two lights were a few degrees apart, one above the other and were white colored and stationary.  my attention was drawn to them because instinctually i knew they didn't belong there.....After all i had just aimed my camera in that exact direction and they weren't there 30 seconds before.  suddenly both lights became brighter and brighter to the point where they were easily the brightest objects in the night sky.  a few seconds later, they dimmed slowly to the point where after a few seconds....They were invisible.  the whole incident lasted around 10 seconds.  shocked and extremely interested, i zoomed my wide angle lens in as far as it would go.....Which isn't much (24mm) and i attempted to take a couple more pics.  \n\nmy first thoughts were \"holy sh*t, i just saw my first true ufo\".  i've always had interest in ufo's and my personal opinion is that through simple mathematical reasoning, there must be not only life on other planets, but copious amounts of intelligent life all over the universe.  life that has technology far more advanced than we could even imagine.\n\nanyway, still reeling from the experience, i proceeded to take many more shots of the sky then went home.  as i was driving home, i was hoping to myself that i got a picture of these two stationary lights.  after all, the wide angle lens was pointed in the general direction of the strange lights.\n\nnothing could prepare me for what i saw when i uploaded my pictures to my imac......I got you!  not only did i get a great shot of the lights, but my camera picked up what my eyes didn't (because i was looking away during the exposure).  my camera caught movement!  the entire time i saw these two lights, they were stationary, but the camera caught them \"arriving\".  the photo speaks for itself.\n\nall i have to say is, what the hell is it?  and is it one craft with two lights or two crafts each lit up?\n\n~ralph d.", "duration": "00:00:15", "imange_name": "819.png", "location": "New York,New York", "shape": "Unknown",

was ahead of the stray clouds and it moved westward and then upward behind the clouds. by this time i knew what i was looking at - no way was this a plane. after a few minutes the one in the clouds reappeared and i asked (s) to look at it. we both watched it quickly change directions from moving upward to moving east and then a second one appeared at the same time floating upwards. aside from

oval disc followed but without the initial glowing, doing the same course.\n\nalso, at the west, another one appeared! it was polygon/multicube shaped, silverish with highly reflective surface, following a descending course down at an angle. many weak red lights on it, almost in every corner of those polygons of it. it seemed to change shape, from being amorphous at start, to multicube and, sort of inflating itself.\n\nfinally a triangle shaped with dark surface and four lights (one in each corner and another one at the center), followed the other two oval shaped. the triangle one,

one appeared on the left and one on the right, it's hard to judge distance between them, but i snapped photos this time. they look like stars at first but then they slowly hover but stay in the same spot. i saw different colored lights on the bottom of the objects. the only way i can describe this, is that it looked like blinking octopus tentacles moving underneath the object in different colors. i was frustrated about not being able to get video, but i have a few short clips. \n\nthe first time i had seen one of them, i said to myself, that is not a plane or helicopter because it hovers and stays stationary. it was around 6 pm ( it had just gotten dark) and i watched it for awhile standing outside of my car. it was facing slightly south, not quite the back of the house, but on the side looking at it from the driveway. i just said to myself, hmmm, strange, i wonder what that could be and i went into the house. later that night (i don't remember the date) i was awoken at approximately 2 am, my bed actually shook and i heard an extremely loud rumbling. i stumbled to my window (south facing) looked out and saw one of those huge black army helicopters (a black hawk?) it looked like the helicopters seen in vietnam footage, the doors were open, it was completely black and flew right past my home going southwest i believe (i'm not great with a sense of direction) it was so close, i couldn't believe my eyes.  it felt like an earthquake almost as it went by. it scared the daylights out of me. this sighting i believe was in october or november of 2016. both sightings i saw either a plane or helicopter passing the object.\n\nback to april 9th. one of the objects, the one on the right (i would say higher than the tree line) blinked and disappeared several times. i saw a chemtrail ( i notice many chemtrails during the day but never at night) directly pass the object horizontally and the sky in that area turned a light gray. the object faded in and out. the objects sometimes appeared to be rectangle in shape as seen in the photos. \n\nseveral hours later i checked to see if they were still there and to my surprise both were almost directly over my house.  i was struggling to see them from the window looking up, that's how much closer they had moved in that time (perhaps 3 hours went by) the window faces east. they stayed in the same positions with the distance between them one on the left and one on the right but had moved so much closer.  i was excited to see this and for a 2nd time. i was shocked when i saw the photos, because there is no denying what i had seen was real. i am hoping they come back.", "duration": "04:00:00", "imange_name": "868.png", "location": "Worcester,Massachusetts", "shape": "Disc", "sighted_at": "2017-04-09"},{"reported_at":

intersection, i noticed a silver object in the sky, which i presumed to be a very low flying 747 which struck me to be odd as i was 60 to 70 plus miles away from ohare and midway airports. looking at it closer i noticed it was not moving. i took off my sunglasses to see if i could see it better, but as soon as i did that it disappeared. putting them back on, you could easily see it again. i figured this was related to the polarized lens....Veru weird though. i immediately changed my direction to head north towards it. driving very fast, i was only about 2 miles from the object that was only about 3,000 feet in the air. i had never seen anything like this in my life. as i got closer the object began to move. at this time, i immediately felt light headed and a headache ensued (which i rarely get...Related idk). at the same moment hundreds of birds began to flock away from the object.  it changed its direction a few times and began to head north. i hopped on i-57 towards chicago and drove very fast so i would not lose sight of it. as i did this the craft picked up incredible speeds towards increased altitude dramatocally. if i had to guess, roughly 15 times faster than a typical 747, but this is likely an underestimate. i was dumbfounded concluding the only explanation is new military technology or extraterrestrial. unfortuantely, the object moved so fast that it disappeared in the distance in less than 30 seconds. i decided i would turn around at the next exit at this point as it was long gone. i slowed down a bit because i noticed an unmarked all black police car flashing white, yellow, red, and blue lights pulled off on the side of the interstate. i could not identify the model, as it was a car i had never seen before and i know my cars very well. i would say the closest car would be a chrysler 300 with a sleek body kit, maybe it's the 2018 version. who knows. as i approached it i noticed it had us government plates with no other vehicles pulled over next to it and i could not see into the windows as i passed, they were tinted which striked me as odd. i thought it might be related to the presence of the craft so i kept driving past the next exit. i continued on the expressway for another 10 to 12 miles to see if anything odd would appear. as i began to merge into the right lane to get off the expressway i saw it again...Maybe 10 to 15 miles west of me hovering above a radio tower. at this point i tried to snap a photo, but figured it would not work as i could not see the object without my polarized lens. i got off the freeway and headed west towards the object which was likely above frankfort, il.  at this point i noticed a prop plane heading towards it from the east and two dark planes flying in formation from the north. at this point i was about 5 miles away from it, but as the jets approached the craft it accelerated south at a very high speeds. the best part was the fact you could see it breaking the sound barrier within a matter of a few seconds. it picked up speeds so fast and headed into the skies where i lost sight of it within 10 seconds. i pulled off the road to turn around and see what types of planes where approaching. they were two fighter jets, maybe the f35 but i couldn't say definitely. they had no chance of keeping up with the object though. i hopped back on the freeway and on my way back home i noticed a strong presence of police cars. i saw 15-20 in the 20 minute drive home. as i approached my town i noticed more police lights, a fire truck, and ambulence which was weird because it was right where i began to have a headache. there was a car in the ditch on one side of the road and two cars that collided at the intersection. maybe it was just all a coincidence though, but it was very odd coincidence as i live in a farming town. i reviewed the photos i took and i managed to capture the object on one of them, which i will upload. i watched the six oclock news to see if anyone else reported it, but no news at all regarding craft, military testing, fighter jets, etc. hoping someone will see this post and possibly confirm some of these events. lastly, i have been keeping an eye out for an odd activity over the last few days. i noticed a strange, constant light that traveled much faster than the any of the other planes that fly over my house the night after. additionally, i worked outside the day after and today on the landscaping. i kept hearing roaring jet engines over the house. this occured 6 or 7 times since i saw the object on june 7th. unfortunately it has been cloudy here since then, but i can only confirm that i saw a fighter jet on two of these occasions during the day. i've lived hear since 2004 and have only seen a fighter jet once so all of this is very odd. hope someone else can provide an explanation. thanks. note: the attached photo is the original unedited photo. it has the object on the right side, if you zoom on you can see the radio tower in the distance 10 to 15 miles away or so. it is directly above the radio tower.", "duration": "", "imange_name": "883.png", "location": "Manteno,Illinois", "shape": "Disc", "sighted_at":

starlike.  small.  i'll add i was wearing sunglasses.  without them, the sky washed the orb out visually since i'm photo-sensitive.  i paused, went oh hell no... went inside and grabbed my camera, hoping to catch it on camera but it was gone.  i always look up.  that's another story.  \n\nthen, i saw another reflective high altitude orb approaching from the west, traveling east through the sun's path.  for the record, i use the word orb, just because stars are stars.  but this was too high to be anything but having the appearance of a distant daytime star.. to end the confusion.  i moved my position to block out the sun and starting recording.  for some reason, i remember learning that a long time ago when recording ufos.  barely block out the sun.  i was facing west, in front of my apartment.  there's an overhang for the garage i used to block and started recording. \n\nthese aren't the little specs of light that dance around when looking at clear sky, or the other artifacts high in the air that reflect the sunlight, ice, etc... or even birds... i'll admit, they're all on the video.  but... why i recorded...  and if you pay attention, is because of the 20+ daytime star orbs that were high altitude and going in a straight line and/or changing direction.  \n\nthe further away from my vantage, away from the sun, they got... eventually they faded into the blue of the sky.  my knowledge tells me that the sun's reflection was too much for whatever cloaking tech was used, and eventually the further they got, they were able to once again disappear within the blue. \n\ni have the cell videos, taken on an iphone 7 plus.   it's still on the iphone.  i took screenshots from the video. they are way too fast to be a plane.  i've slowed it down to 25% in imovie.  it's a lot more impressive.  personally, air traffic control has nothing on how busy it is up there if you know where to look. \n\nimages were screenshots from my iphone 7... screenshots taken on the iphone 7.  then simply circled in paintbrush for mac.  i have a digital forensics background, hence my explanations, and trying to be specific as possible.  i am not a digital forensic image specialist.  i deal with straight e-discovery litigation type support.  i just understand forensic integrity.\n\ni know what's going on in general and moreso.   i'd work for you if i could.  but due to a recent personal evolution per say, i'm just here because i decided to share some images.  no more no less.   \n\nwe're in the mayan age of heart.  no longer time to dance around the issue.  i'll share what i come across. not for myself, but others need to know.", "duration": "00:30:00", "imange_name": "936.png", "location": "Houston,Texas", "shape": "Star-like", "sighted_at":

at decoy in the late 19th century and the clay was both mined and quarried at the site from 1850 until 1965. when the quarrying ceased the pit quickly filled with water and became the deep lake that we see today. i believe that these objects are going in and out of this lake undetected. i know for a fact that these alien craft have the ability to cloak and become completely invisible to the naked eye, furthermore they have the ability to enter the water without making a splash or any sound. i believe that there could be an alien base or a portal at the bottom of decoy lake and i also believe this is were the alien crafts are emerging from. decoy lake would be a great place to hide and be undetected. two years ago while investigating this area for any evidence of this i had an encounter

i was taking images about every 15 seconds as i was trying varying shutter speeds.  when i began processing the images, i noticed that there were some dot-like objects which were surrounding the disc of the sun.  there initially were a white, a blue, and a red colored object all in different locations.  \n\nat first i wondered if they were stars.  but between the two frames in which i first noticed them, they were moving in various ways by the second frame.\n\nimage # 75 was taken at 1/125th second at f9, and iso 200 at 2:28:29 pm.\nthe next frame, image # 76 was taken at 1/60th second at same f9 and iso 200.\nin the first image, one will notice just beyond 6 o'clock outside the rim of the sun, a blue dot.  there is also a red dot further out near the bottom of the page in the left corner.  the blue dot is at 6 degrees to the left of center of the sun, and the red dot is at 31 degrees.\nby the next frame, the blue dot had moved from 6 to 25 degrees and the red dot from 31 to 38 degrees.  my first thought was that they could be stars.   if they had been stars--they would have remained basically in the same location from my perspective in 15 seconds.  they appear to be some kind of craft as they have independent motion.  for image #75, if one looks near 4 o'clock, a faint white dot can be seen, and on the second image, near 11 o'clock another faint dot.  there are actually 2 there when the image is blown up.\n\nwhen comparing the images, if they were stars, the distance between the red and the blue \"craft\" should stay the same from #75 and #76.  despite the different crop size of the images, when i account for the difference and mathematically account for the difference between the two blue and red dots, they change.  in the first image, that sun is 1.345 times larger than the sun in the second image.  so, the distances will also be 1.345 times different.  mathematically accounting for this or \"standardizing\" it allows us to compare what is going on between the \"craft\" in both images.\n\n1.  the distance between the two dots on a printout of the two pages...For image # 76 is 80 mm between the 2 dots.\n2.  the calculated distance of the two dots on the first image, if they were stars, would be the same.  they are not...The calculated distance between the two dots in image # 75 is 76.6 mm.  so, there was a change not only of angular distance, but also 3.4 mm between them. they were getting further from each other by 4.25%.\n\nthe 2nd image red dot is going away from the rim of the sun.  the change is 4.7% with the first red dot.\nthe 2nd image blue dot is going toward the rim of the sun.  the change is 11.5% with the first blue dot.\nthe distance between the two craft in the second image got larger by 4.25 %.  together with the angular change, these clearly cannot be stars. \nall together i took 10 images starting at # 70, and ending with # 79.  upon a cursory first check, images 73 to 79 all have varying numbers of these \u201cdot\u201d craft.  as mentioned earlier, they were all taken roughly 15 seconds apart as i adjusted the shutter speed from image to image.\ni next wondered if the solar heliospheric observatory (soho) images for the same day would show anything similar.  since soho is in space, it does not have intervening atmosphere, and had a clearer view of that white object, i decided to work on seeing if i could clean it up a bit. \n\ni have attached a soho image (the 4th of 4) taken 6 hours earlier than mine almost to the minute.  one can see something in the upper right quadrant that is not in the other three soho images taken at 13:00, 13:06, 13:13 ut time.  so within 19 minutes of the first image taken today, there does show something that was not there in the other three images.  after processing the image, i was able to detect a spherical silver colored shape with a red light above it, and a red light below it.\n\nnext i wondered if any of the four photos taken the previous day on may 8th might show an object.  of the four images taken by soho, the third one taken at 13:13 ut shows an object near 6 o\u2019clock.  upon processing, that image appears to be spherical and silver colored, but without the lights.", "duration": "00:02:21", "imange_name": "956.png", "location": "Lee's Summit,Missouri", "shape": "Sphere", "sighted_at": "2017-05-07"},{"reported_at":

like they normally would. it seemed eerily quiet except for the feel and subtle noise of the hum. i decided to take pictures because something seemed different about these clouds; they didn't seem normal.I didn't see the objects in the sky, it wasn't until i took the pictures that i could see them in the photo. after the first couple of photos i took pictures about every 10 minutes or so until they all passed. first it was the strange clouds that felt eerie then a rainbow then a cluster of cumulus looking clouds that were extremely bright, i don't know if it's normal for clouds that are opposite the sun to have a glow to them but the last bit of clouds seemed to have a glow within them. all i know is that the last bit of clouds was so bright i could hardly look at them but they were

a blue aura, and there's a trail of more blue aura ahead of this blue disk which looks like it was created by a different craft or object. the third photo shows the blue object clearer, and moving.

u-turn. i never saw any of this with my naked eye. after all, i was trying to photograph the sun. i would have kept taking photos if i saw it in the sky. my photos are bizarre if you are expecting to rationalize what that blue glowing object is that flies at supersonic speeds and then does a u-turn.\nplease help! if this a natural phenomenon then why do my photos show an object. why is the object

image 6268 there is a tiny black dot above a small white cloud. it is almost in the same position that the green orb appears in the following image. when i zoom in on the dot it does not appear to me to be a bird. i remained in the same position facing west while i took all of the images. the only change that i made was to zoom in and out on the sun setting behind the clouds. the sun was so bright that i didn't see the orb until i looked at the images on the camera. because i didn't actually see it outside i am not sure of the size or distance. there is a trail visible from a plane in the photos and it appears closer than the plane but i'm not sure. it moved to the left of it's original position and then it wasn't visible for one image and then it appeared in the top center of the next image. it continued up and to the left until it was no longer visible. the trees on the right side of the images are on my property approximately 75 to 100 feet in front of where i was standing. the tree that are along the bottom of the images are across the street. \n i also photographed the same green orb back on 2-21-17 at 3:42 pm in summerfield, florida. i took 6 images with my iphone 7

from the sun, either top or bottom, but not at the same time. the edges seemed rounded, like an oval. it was mostly dark and dull colored though sometimes seemed faintly maroon or reddish brown. at some points, for a split second, it was invisible and blended in with the sky, which you can see from the attached videos. \n\nthe object was definitely smaller than a helicopter, and could have been closer in size to a canoe. it moved in a steady path, never changing altitude. i took a photo at 10:57 am and finished taking video at 10:59 am. the object came from the east, going west, but i last

object moving from center-right to the left. i took screen screen-grabs of the videos and circled the object, to give you a reference point of where to look. there really isn't enough resolution to

blends into the blue sky for a split second, a few times, as i described. i am certain it wasn't a balloon because it maintained a steady path at a consistent altitude. it wasn't jerky or lurching - it was an a steady aerial path. what is this? i desperately tried to see rotors but there was nothing that i could see, only the oval-ish shape.", "duration": "00:02:00", "imange_name": "982.png",

driving westbound on camelback road, which runs just south of the border of luke afb. i was returning a borrowed video camera and my four year old son was with me. it was january 1998. then i saw six air force fighter jets take off in front of me, right over the road and flew right over our car. my first thought was \"night maneuvers,\" because tensions were high in the persian gulf at that time. then i thought, \"those guys are going out like they're really going to fight,\" and i wondered if it was safe for them to take off so close together like that. then i looked to the direction they were flying, and i saw it. it was a big, black, upside down triangle with orange lights at each point of the triangle. that thing was huge - the planes few towards it for a long time, and never seemed to get close to it, though the planes were shrinking in the distance. then i felt kind of \"funny\" in my head. i was driving the speed limit there, which at the time was 55 mph. the road was bumpy, but at that time, i wasn't feeling the bumps in the road. i couldn't take my eyes off of it. then i realized my four year old was parroting what was going through my own mind. it was a \"voice\" that wasn't a voice, but more like thoughts. i got angry after a couple of minutes and said out loud, \"get the f*** out of my head!\" then it felt like the car \"thudded\" like it was being dropped to the ground and i felt the bumpy road under me again. then, just like turning off a light switch, the big, black triangle just disappeared. it didn't fly off, it didn't change direction, it was just gone. the fighter jets were flying all over up there where it had been, in circles. i was scared and was glad that they were up there. then they landed and i realized how alone i was on that road and how dark. i was terrified and actually peed my pants. my son said, \"mommie, why did the pretty boat go away?\" he didn't remember it the next day, never spoke of it and to this day, has no memory of the incident. i had to pull over for a few minutes, then realized again how dark and alone i was out there, so i speeded up, praying i would be stopped by a cop, so i wouldn't be alone. the next day, luke afb came out in the paper and said they had no reports and had no idea what anyone was talking about. apparently, this had been reported by other people. i know they weren't revealing what they knew, because i personally saw those fighter jets take off and go after it. i don't know whether to think those pilots were incredibly brave or incredibly stupid, but i was certainly glad to see them. i am willing to polygraph on what i saw. i have told my story to a few other people, but i usually keep pretty quiet about it. \n\ni am attaching a rough drawing of the sighting. hopefully this will make

the dog out and have a cigarette. during this time i noticed a \"twinkling star\" to the south about 15* off the horizon. after watching for a few moments i could see it was actually moving up, as it was cropped by hanging power lines. at this time i went in to grab my nikon 10x50 magnification binoculars used frequently for star-gazing and plane-spotting.  \n\nthrough the binoculars, it appeared to be a low-flying aircraft as it had steady red and green wingtip lights, a steady white light in the center, and an initially masked center red-strobe; giving \"twinkle\" appearance. it moved very, very slowly, compared to commercial aircraft seen at similar size and angle off horizon, traveling in a north/northeast flight path and moved by my position to the east. a cigarette takes about 6-7 minutes, of which i ended up smoking two, with time to spare.\n\nwhen it was its closest, it was about 40* degree off the ground, and 90* attitude relative to me. i could clearly see that it was a distinctly triangle shaped air-frame, with 3 solid white lights on each apex, and an irregularly strobing red light in its center. the green/red 'wingtip' lights were not visible from the rear of the craft, but could be seen briefly as being mounted in tandem with a solid white light aft of each tip.\n\nas it passed 90* to me, it appeared to be 3 solid white lights, with the center red strobe still visible, and without binoculars, looked like a bright star; red strobe not visible without binoculars. the vehicle for how close it was was dead silent; no hum or vibration. during this a commercial aircraft flew directly overhead (sw>ne) at cruise alt. (~40k ft) and was heard after it passed over. \n\nonce passed, the front, center, front-facing red-green lights were not visible, but has a distinct diamond shape, from the rear; with 3 solid white lights visible (none on bottom corner of 'diamond'). the diamond shape was not visible without binoculars and appeared in the same place a vertical stabilizer would be. \n\nit was close enough to see the lights of the vehicle reflect of it's surface but no discerned structural features could be seen; general shape akin to an equilateral arrowhead; progressively thicker along the center line; fore to aft. \n\nnotable comments:\nthe 'diamond' shape was the most striking feature of craft. \nalso noted mentally the light configuration was \"a good trick\" for potentially deceiving any onlookers as it moved so slowly so as to be almost stationary; and lighting made it appear like a normal aircraft or star, depending on orientation. \nalso noted at the time was how it made literally no sound.\n\npictures:\nthe pictures attached were sketched immediately after, and updated the following day after using ios app: \"spyglass\" to get the relative headings and angle of ascent. the sketches are the cardinal direction and degrees above horizon. \n\nfiles:\nimg_3747.Png : #1 - first seen 1/4\nimg_3754.Png : #2 - near 90* 2/4\nimg_3755.Png : #3 - at 90* (closest) 3/4\nimg_3762.Png

noticed it would become very bright for a minute or two, and then would quickly dim the lights and then completely turn them off.  \n\nas we all watch this, my sister and brother-in-law said when they noticed it, it was changing colors; however, i didn't notice any other colors than white at that time.  we watched it there for about ten minutes, thinking it would quickly go away, but it didn't.  we then decided to get in the car and see if we could get a closer look.  it took at least 30 minutes to get out to where it was, which was just west of bakersfield and east of the i-5 freeway nearest to

were present and i feel that the lights were much further than the power lines, but i can't be positive about that. a short time later, two other lights appeared. i took video of the two lights and one light was traveling slowly and appeared to go through a power line, but that could have been because i was in full zoom and the camera was shaky and it may have made the light appear to do so. i had my camera set to photograph in raw which i hoped would have captured  good detail, but the lights seemed faraway and the photos were not of the greatest quality. even still, i believe that you can see that it is not an airplane, and in my opinion the lights didn't seem close to the power lines, but again i can't be sure. i contradict myself in saying that in viewing the video, the lights appear to be right at the power lines, but if that is the case the lights are a big as the power line are thick. i have converted the raw files to jpeg.", "reported_at": "2017-04-28", "imange_name":

about 45 degrees or slightly higher from the horizon.   that\u2019s when i saw a small stationary object in the sky just below the clouds.  it didn\u2019t appear to be a plane off in the distance.  it had no movement, and its shape and color didn\u2019t fit that of a plane.  it almost shimmered but to more accurately describe it, it looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.  it looked like it was slightly phasing in and out.  the clouds were not obstructing my view.  they were above it.   the phasing was more like coming into focus then softly losing its integrity but not losing its outline.  it continued phasing in/out the entire time i viewed it.  the object didn\u2019t have a solid outline like that of an airplane.  the outline was a somewhat fuzzy but i could still make out the dome shape (walnut-dome like shape with a flattened ring around the center).  the sighting lasted about 7 seconds then the object disappeared.  it didn\u2019t fly off.  it just vanished.  a second later, i drove by some trees that blocked my view .  the road curved slightly back to the east.  i stopped at the intersection waiting for the light to change.  i looked back up to the sky but the sun was more in my line of site at this point, and i could not see as well.  i still had about a 45-minute drive to atlanta.  i continued to look for the object/craft but did not see it again.  at first i was in disbelief that i saw something that i couldn\u2019t explain.  i immediately started taking notes of what i saw.  at each intersection that i stopped, i wrote down a few more notes.  the more i thought of it, i felt some excitement but then i started to think, \u2018what else could it be?\u2019  it didn\u2019t have a definite shape or appearance like a drone or a plane.   what really stood out was that the object was phasing or shimmering in and out and not moving in any direction.  the rest of that morning i kept looking at the sky, hoping to see it again and maybe i\u2019d be able to tell what it really was, maybe see something that could explain what i saw.  i was looking for evidence that it was man-made or some explanation and then i could put this to rest and not focus on it

strange orange coloured object. the third shows two strong 'strands' established across the picture. if all three pictures are played in sequence, a kind of animation is seen of the event. the aircraft is running across the top as a form of time sequence proof.\n\nother pictures i took that same night included regular observed satellites, and aircraft etc. no such similar events were recorded, so there is nothing wrong with my camera or technique i was using. the camera was on a tripod with cable release on 30 second exposures for the stars. my wife was with me at the time. i have

after sunset and the sky was getting dark, but not dark enough to see stars yet.  i had been by myself putting things away in the sheds for the night and on my way back to the house, i got a glimpse of something in the sky. i stopped to observe it.\n\nwhat i saw was a luminous circle west of me at an elevation of about 30 degrees. the circle was light blue and about the size of a light bulb seen from 10 feet away. the object was self-luminescent, but not very bright. the best way to visualize it is to imagine a circle of daytime blue sky in the darker sky.\n\nthe object was rising slowly at about half an inch per second from my point of view.  since the shape was not changing, i assumed it was a sphere. there was no noise at this point. i got to watch the object for less than 10 seconds and then, it exploded. it broke apart in chunks that started tumbling in free fall, leaving turbulent trails the same light blue as the original object. the trails faded within a second.\n\na few seconds after the explosion (i'd say 3 to 5 seconds), i heard the muffled sound of a blast, much like the sound made when someone ignites a gas stove. i deduced from that that the object couldn't have been too far away. there was no sound or vibration related to ground impact.\n\nthe funny thing is after seeing this, i just casually went inside the house and never spoke of it with my parents even though i used to talk about ufos with my father once in a while. he had a few sightings of his own in his younger days.  i didn't even ask if they had seen it.  in hindsight, it feels has though i had been influenced in some way not to discuss it or that i somehow forgot it right away and that the memory only came back afterwards.  also, i can now remember the details of the sighting quite clearly,

very very bright. once recording it though i zoomed in and out trying to get a better idea of what it could be. i wanted to watch my video whilst the object was still statinary in the sky to get a better idea of what it was. i zoomed in and i'd see it looked like a fireball, almost like it had a ring around it, i looked up again to see it still in the sky, it then after about another 30 seconds

after dinner, which was around 8:00 pm. my dad, brother and i went outside and were watching the planes fly over. we have always been very intrigued with aviation.  my brother lives very close the detroit metro airport as well so we frequently find ourselves outside watching the planes landing and taking off. at the time there were about six jets flying in different directions and at various altitudes all with visible contrails.  \n\nwhile we were standing in the driveway we noticed a jet flying from north to south at a very high altitude due to the contrails behind it.  we started talking about it and was estimating it was moving around 500-700 mph at an altitude greater than 30,000 ft. they continued to talk to about planes while i surveyed the sky in curiosity. at this point, this is when i noticed a shiny star-like object just above the contrail the plane had just left. i stood there glued to this object because it seemed to not move nor did it look like a star, it was too shiny. i am always on the look out for strange events and decided i should take a photo. i tried retrieving my phone without taking my eyes away from it but i couldn't get my camera on my phone engaged, so i looked away.  \n\nit only took a few seconds to get my camera ready and when i looked for the shining object i couldn't find it, which was strange. at this point, i asked my brother and dad if they had seen the star-like object above the contrail that i was looking at and they, unfortunately, didn't see it.  my brother insisted that it was probably a satellite reflecting the sun. i told him that would be impossible because of the time of day and that the object wasn't moving at all,  i personally just thought it was a star. so, i looked around for a few mins scanning the sky like some houdini just pulled a fast one on me. it was about three mins after i noticed it was gone that i took two photos, only one had something interesting.  \n\nafter i snapped the shots i looked on my phone and obviously didn't see anything. so, kind of blew it off for the rest of the night. it was after i got home and opened up the photos on my computer i noticed something after enlarging the photo, i had picked up two black triangles in the same location of the star like object that i had seen before.  \n\nwhen i took this photo, all the planes had flown off and there were no birds in the sky that i could see. i also do not think that birds would be visible from the distance these objects are seen. if so, those are some big birds and we have a totally different story! i'm really happy to have picked up something because i was feeling a bit annoyed that i was the only person to have seen the object in the sky. now i have some sort of proof that i wasn't totally losing it, ha.

watched it for about 90 seconds in disbelief and shock, i've never seen any thing close to a ufo. i want to think it was a group of helicopters but i couldn't hear any propellers and i don't think it

pictures on my cell phone and noticed that one picture taken from my room had a odd image in the top left of it. i expanded the picture out and saw that it looked like a round disc that looked as if it was moving because of the image. see picture. i went to the store and had pictures made. the object was unbelivible. i had a larger blow up made and could not believe that this was on the picture. after showing several friends the picture all of them immediately said what is that a ufo. after getting the pictures i made a decision to contact you to report what was on the picture. the other two pictures did not show anything that i could see. on friday night before this happened las vegas has a very big storm. i have submitted three pictures for review.", "reported_at": "2017-04-07",

was on my phone looking at the live sedona webcam. i live in connecticut and i've vacationed in sedona in the past, if i have a free moment in my day i'll look at the live webcam. i've been looking at the webcam for over a year now at different times throughout the day and never saw anything out of the ordinary except for when objects started to appear in the sky on 3/21/17.\n\non 3/21/17 at 9:43am edt (6:43am mst) the first object appeared. i noticed the object was out of place for the morning sunrise and at first glance i thought it was a passing satelitte or a drone, however; the object didn't move it was stationary. i took a screenshot and after a few seconds the webcam moved direction. once enlarging the object on my phone the shape and the light emanating from the object was unusual. after 5 minutes the webcam went back to the location where i saw the object and the object wasn't in the sky anymore.  \n\ndue to this peculiarity i kept looking at the webcam throughout the day and saw a second object in the sky that differed from the first one i had witnessed.\n\nlater that afternoon, at 3:10pm est (12:10pm mst) i saw the second object in the sky at a different location. this object differed to the first object, this one was dark in color, circular and didn't have a glow or light emanating from it like the first object. i took a screenshot of this object and it stayed in the sky at the same location for several hours without moving. at first glance i thought it was a weird cloud but as the webcam stayed fixed at the location for several minutes the object didn't move. i also thought there might be a smudge on the lens of the webcam, this wasn't the case because whenever the webcam moved to a different location there wasn't any circular dark spot visible at other locales. this second object appeared over the course of 3 days and always in the same location. interestingly, each when i looked at the webcam the object slightly changed it's shape, as if it was fluid in nature. i have several photos of this object over the 3 day period it was visible. \n\non 3/23/17 at 8:16pm edt (5:16pm mst) the second object was visible again albeit it was a cloudy day. i have several screenshots over the course of thirteen minutes of the object. because it was  cloudy one can see the cloud movements from one photo to the next, but the dark circular object remained stationary. \n\non 3/23/17 in the evening at 10:01pm edt (7:01pm mst) over the course of 3 minutes i saw a third object. this object was a large light orb up against the mountainside that's within a valley area. the light orb went dim and then went to a full brightness. upon seeing this my reaction was disbelief because this valley/mountain area doesn't have any residential homes, roads, nor are there any aircraft warning lights for pilots to look out for. the light orb was too big to be a hiker's flashlight and the light certainly wasn't from a camper's fire. \n\non 3/24/17 at 5:10pm edt (3:10pm mst) the second object was in the sky again for a third day, this time the dark circular object really changed it's shape and appeared to be slightly triangular. i have several photos over the course of an hour on 3/24/17 showing this object. in addition, i have a photo after the object left, to show that its not something fixed in the sky. \n\nthe photos attached are a few of what i took, i also have screenshot photos showing the day/time for each photo when it was taken, should you require this.", "reported_at": "2017-03-27", "imange_name": "1142.png", "duration":

the crowed inside of the house, of about 20+ people both inside and outside of the backyard, i over heard the young lady expecting the baby shout \" look at the sky everyone , look \" i immediately ran out the backdoor of the residence to find everyone looking up and pointing up at the night sky. some had cell phones other didn't and just pointed with their fingers. as everyone gasped in awe and commented on what where the unidentified things over above our heads, i grabbed a chair and stood on it. to my amazement, through the branches of the trees, i saw a massive amount of star-like white orbs, about 50 + , the size of bb's . these things emitted no sound whatsoever and they were in a semi-line formation and scattered a little bit, in a zig-zag shoe lace matter, then back in a straight line vertical formation. some orbs stood stationary , while others moved around. in my personal opinion this was all individual lights and not part of one solid single structure. i ran through the cluster of people observing this event , to the front of the house to get a better view. i got a better image of the lights and they were still moving in a very slow moving pace , still in a line formation. i then ran to my house to viciously knocked on my door to alert my wife of what i was seeing. she came outside and amazed, she also saw the star-like orbs , at this time the white orbs where separating in a zig-zag shoe lace formation once again and then slowly made their way further out until the massive amount of lights went over the houses and we could no longer see them.",

thirteenth in january and it also happened to be my friends birthday so i can remember quite vividly what happened. i got out of work around eight o'clock and i went home to let my dog out and i went out to the lake to go see him and hang out with friends. i got to his house around 9 and we hung out for 45 minutes or so when we decided to go to\nwalmart with his brother and another friend because i just bought a new car and he wanted to get a video game. so we all piled into the car and we went to walmart. we left the brewer walmart around 10:50 right befor they closed at 11 and we headed back towards orrington. we were heading up the brewer lake road and went around an 's' turn and we had noticed these red lights down the road above the dam on the lake. we aren't far away from bangor international airport so it didn't seem like there was anything unusual about something like that; it looked like it was just beyond the dam and it was flying parallel to the road so it looked like it could of been a plane coming in. but there was something unusual about it so when we saw it i started talking about i swear i saw a ufo the previous january. as we drove down the road closer to the object, (and i'm still talking about the ufo) it was like it heard me talking about ufo's because this triangular silhouette went from being far off the road and fairly high in the air (500 - 700 feet) to swooping in very close probably on 400 feet off the road and 200 feet high. the way the object moved down closer was very odd and i was euphoric but terrified at the same time. it was flat with the horizon when the object dipped up once side at a 20 to 30 degrees and swooped in closer; the best way to describe it is the way a feather or a leaf falls to the ground and swoops side to side. after it swooped down close to the car everyone started to have this moment of awe yet panicky. i slowed down the car and pulled off to the side of the road and it was just us four at the time because it was 11 at night. i turned the radio off and i rolled all the windows down and it was dead silent. that too quiet type of quiets and we were all looking at the black equilateral triangle that had glowing bright red lights on each end. the object also had a center light that glowed white and the object was dark against the clear night sky and it had to of been 40 to 60 feet across. as we were looking at it one of my friends in the back seat pulled out her phone and tried to film it on her iphone but we looked at the video after and we couldn't see anything but darkness. while she was filming i kept almost driving my new car off the road into a ditch because this object seemed to be hovering closer to us. i felt like if it kept getting closer i didn't even so i kept driving slowly down the road  going back to my friends house and we turned the corner away from the ufo and this bigger triangular thing was across the lake above the holden/bucksport side of the lake heading towards the direction of the black triangle ufo (this could have been an airplane but it was still dead silent). i was still driving slowly down the road when i stopped and started talking to everyone in the car and we decided to turn around and go back and investigate. when we went back to the area where i pulled of the road of course the object was gone along with whatever the larger object was. for weeks after i kept dreaming about that 4 or 5 minutes of my life and it was odd it happened on friday the 13th.
